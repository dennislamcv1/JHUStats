       "9996  Herbert paid his debt to society by twiddling away the days in solitary confinement. Herbert’s personally prohibited him from becoming familiar with the inmates he was stranded with. Being friends with anyone wasn’t an option. It became a well-know fact that he couldn’t get along with others, especially in confined places. Whenever he was in the general population, he pursued fights on a daily basis. Arguments were his passion and ”asshole” soon became his middle name. Not even the meanest of the mean would mess with Herbert. The years put a definition of anger in the creases of his drawn face. The look of a psychopath was naturally etched into his smile. Inmates made it a point to stay away from Herbert whenever he wasn’t being kept in solitude. However, when he was alone, away from all other prisoners, Herbert was the perfect inmate. The guards had no problems with him. They came to the understanding that Herbert caused fight in order to stay out of general population. “Clooney, ...\n",

kids following me around, you know doing more shit for me than the boys that wanted inside of me. especially the two in particular. they thought i was “so wonderful” which sickened me even further. i was not wonderful, it reminds me of that quote, from wwii era forget it but goes on to say something like, “it was not that i was a hero, it was everyone around me was acting so badly” when someone won a humanitarian award.nicholas’ brain runs on and is excellent at processing data and concrete facts. he works best with things he can quantify. he runs into an almost insurmountable challenge in trying to rationalize the existence of his exceptional infant daughter and what she represents. he isn’t without a sense of humor and is very loving but he is forced to radically confront his limitations.but this isn’t a speech about economic inequality. it’s about my reelection.games during dinneri will be taking a picture of me in my race outfit so you can be sure to see me (i wore it on sunday am, so it’s in the wash right now), but i will post a pic in the next few days.she heard me loud and clear.his own family had to witness exclusion and had to be apprehensive to be pusuited. so

success! this was a great show, with enthusiastic crowds and everyone is already looking forward to the october show at the domain.my sweet boy, who i dote on, is quite capable of doing this (resisting training) for months. he has in the past and patience and consistency are called for and will win the day in the end. he might decide to get with the program this week, or it might be months. time will tell, but i think i know now that this is a likely response from him when training goes to a new level.and so on, and so on...for some reason i didn’t initially investigate any further into her catalogue, but then one friday at work i was talking to another friend who loved ann peebles. the next day, on my way into town to the shops, i decided i simply had to buy a peebles record. my first stop was reckless in berwick st, which still had a basement where a box of soul singles sat on the counter. having inherited not only my dad’s hoarding tendencies, but his acute sense of relative value, i’ve never bought many 7″s (or “45s” as we must trendily refer to them now) and 9/10 times i deliberately avoid looking beyond the lp and 12″ sections in any shop. i was on a mission this time though and miraculously, as i began to flick, there it was, second record in the box, as if i’d just willed it there. i excitedly parted with my £3 and while i have no memory of what if anything else i bought that day, i remember it was definitely raining. getting the record home, i had a bonus discovery with the equally brilliant b-side, part of whose intro is the backbone to a gza track i was a bit obsessed with at the time (a huge proportion of early rza production relies on the hi back catalogue). in contrast to the a-side, the song is much more positive than its title indicates: she’s bidding goodbye to her troubles and sadness, or rather, as is more customary for peebles, telling them to piss off.forest city ratner companies and its brooklyn events center subsidiary would have a tiny fraction of the jobs. some 1000 part-timers would be hired by aeg, in charge of arena operations, and 900 hired by levy restaurants, in charge of food service.then, the most exciting news of all, on august 19th our sweet baby jane joined our family! she was born at 1:59 am after 7 hours of labor (which was so much better than annabelle\\'s 16 hours of labor) and was 7lb 6oz 20 in long. jane looks a lot like annabelle when she was a baby but they definitely have their own personalities. we are so happy this sweet baby girl could join our family and annabelle loves her new little sister! jane is such a little live wire. right when jane was born she could lift her head and was always moving. she isn\\'t my cuddly baby like annabelle was but still a sweet, happy little one. she moves so much she learned to roll over at 3 1/2 months! now at 5 months she is army crawling everywhere!!! crazy huh! she is just a little determined one and is probably going to walk soon i swear!!! jane just had her 4 month dr appointment and she weighed 12 lb 2 oz which makes her only in the 10th percentile . she is just a little one and it\\'s probably because she moves all the time. annabelle is such a good big sister and loves to make her laugh. if she is sad she gives her toys and tries everything to make her happy. but there are those moments when i hear jane cry and i

some form of qa testing before going live. but if it can be done successfully, then developers can spend some more time working on new game features and maybe even bringing in new level caps between

we came out very pleased (and not a little relieved) with how it went.“god undoubtedly took advantage of every opportunity to learn the laws of truth and as he became acquainted with each new verity he righteously obeyed it. as he gained more knowledge through persistent effort and continuous industry, as well as through absolute obedience, his under\\xadstanding of the universal laws continued to become more complete… until he attained the status of godhood. he became god by absolute obedience to all the eternal laws of the gospel” (the gospel through the ages, pp. 114-15).one of the most

hyun-sung (jang hyun-sung), a hard-boiled fund manager, spends an evening of heavy drinking with his co-workers at a restaurant. a colleague shows up with some airsoft rifles, and soon all of them are pointing their weapons every which way and firing them in the busy restaurant. the server asks the guests to put the firearms away, and hyun-sung ends up getting into a brawl with the waiter. the next day, following a probe into the company’s financial dealings and the suicide of one of his associates, kim flees to the wooded retreat of one of his friends, hoping to recover his equilibrium. instead, his buddy convinces him to take part in a war game with some friends. this vigorous if not wholly original exploration of the ruthlessness of business culture firmly embraces the dogme esthetic, the camera crew and boom mike being plainly visible in one restaurant scene.

we\\'d like to see all your creations celebrating something!first of all, knowing that money is a meaningful, dynamic flow we can choose to go with it rather than fight against it. experience shows us that when we follow it, in other words, when we are willing to learn from our money flow, it supports us on our unique life journey and leads eventually to more freedom and lightness. and the other way round: when we fight against it, it often leads to stagnation or crisis.with hope in your hearthere are the rules, such as i ever have rules:as we tremble in the motion foreversince their toddlerhood, ana and og have inspired me to create casual toys based on their interest at that moment, with things handy at home, nothing fancy.i thanked him, and when i left him i said to myself, shaking my head: “you never know. you never know whether you do any good. you never know how much good you do.”the headlights of several vehicles illuminated the barn. as the family tumbled out of the barn’s east door, they were bathed in the harsh light. they shaded their eyes and huddled together hugging one another.jumperskirt: metamorphosei’m rather tempted to stop writing here and see whether any pastors or other readers will answer the question i’ve posed.when i started blogging, i didn’t really know what i was doing. i still don’t. but, along the way, i met other bloggers who i now consider friends. sure, we don’t know each other, not really, but i know that i really enjoy reading their blogs. i’m quite a procrastinator, so chances are that i probably will never get around to following the rules of the award like i am supposed to, but know that i cherish the thought that these women, who both could outwrite me in a blogging duel hands down, thought of me to nominate for this award. i am soo glad that i have met you guys. thank you.when i first heard in sohoand i cut way back on the petting and the treat-giving. a breeder who lives in harmony with a houseful of german shepherds says, \"i never give my dogs too much food, or too much love.\" i thought that, at least temporarily, this was something i could do. finally, even though wolfie is good about coming when called outdoors, i made him walk on the leash instead of letting him run free.uk rule of wealth 1bus daydreaminga squat sir walter raleigh’s which containedi\\'ll try the easier part first.my life also changed i became a mother, my boys grew up with his music, they thought it was fantastic to hear someone sing in the language they spoke.our “occupy” movement would last for the better part of a year, even after i received a stay. day rooms would be “occupied,” hallways. medical. disciplinary hearings. the food slots and showers. non-violently, changes would occur. for the better part of a year, other inmates would be inspired to protest their execution dates, like tommy hughes, marion dudley and lamont reese, whose actions would make the cnbc news. we declared our lives–all lives–have value. our lives–all lives–have worth!

well-organized deployment of enormous sums of money by the business and (especially) the financial elites have in large measure made american politicians, regardless of party, into the tools of the wealthy elites: bush cut taxes on the very rich to near-historic lows, and the right-wing roberts court more or less legalized political bribery in the citizens united decision, but it was bill clinton who began the deregulation of wall street that led first to massive profits for the few, then to an terrible crisis for the many, and it was democrat chuck schumer who kept capital gains taxes so low that most hedge fund managers pay taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries. the koch brothers and those of their ilk don\\'t consider themselves stewards of national well-being, not really: they consider themselves people who have a right to buy the means to rig the system ever-further in their favor. for them, this is simply their prerogative. acting on this presumed prerogative has made them very wealthy, but it has also made their whole class less and less legitimate in the eyes of the public, despite the constant drumbeat of political advertisements and the far-from-disinterested vision of events presented on fox news and other corporate media platforms.my review of the first reading of still life can be found here (feb 2009). i remember liking the book and being impressed with penny\\'s style of writing and i enjoyed the characters, hoping we would meet them again in future books. and we did get to chum with them in the sequels. penny unwraps parts of each character and lets us slowly get acquainted with them as we might a new friend. in this reread i was reminded of earlier descriptions of the characters and to see them in light of what i knew about them from later writings. my word, they are such multi-faceted, complex, flawed, and yet lovable people. the following quote illustrates how well penny brings her characters to life, as well as her understanding of human nature and her gift for expressing it in writing.christians should have nothing to do with evilfor this reason the troops are justified and obliged in this combat to resort

stuff, etc., but i\\'ve never really embraced the \"holiday\" that much. even so, i thought i\\'d post a few pics i came across that i just love, and think they relate beautifully to this little heart day without being too predictable.we are taking kids (from the north) from grades 4-9 to summer camps in the center of the country. we do it to distance the kids from the inferno, and the growing trauma, to put a smile back on their faces, to give them an open space to run, and let them use their imagination and creativity. also, no less important we want to give their parents a rest, some quiet and a little bit less to worry about. i also think that the father of a house when there is less on his shoulders and some of the overload is released it is more likely that he will stay in his

a friend mind you, an acquaintance. v.i. as she prefers - not vicki or victoria and only occasionally vic - is portrayed once again as a brusque, nearly unisex character with conflicted identity issues. even at the age of 50, she’s far too tough on herself. v.i. does some considerable soul searching while assuming the persona of a champion whose mission it is to right injustice.vegan

he said at the time. his gestures aided his overall credibility.\\r\\nryan “so hot the water” broyles tore his acl in november 2011 the same way the compact receiver tore through big12 defenses,

years i was there, five of the ten teachers (three brothers and two laymen) were sexually abusing many of the boys entrusted to their care. one of them was the tall young brother teaching the class parallel to ours, a class in which i was often a guest on the (not infrequent) occasions when mr. mooney called in sick. his ready use of the cane ensured that he had no discipline problems. he also had the custom of having boys sit on his lap for long periods of time – fortunately, he had his particular pets and we guests were not selected for this “special” treatment.our two boys are excited.

resources/privileges as the dominant group. for example: aboriginals receive a significant amount less from welfare than non-aboriginals. internalized oppression is when an oppressed person begins to believe the stereotypes and awful statements about their group; for example, a black woman begins to believe that she is not as deserving of fair treatment as white people are, or a gay man believes he is a sinner and is flawed for ‘choosing’ to be gay. lateral violence is when, as a result of this, an oppressed person retreats to his or her group, or perhaps lashes out at the dominant group or

system vendors in the form of faceplate values. but the use of faceplate value is flawed at the first place as it indicates the maximum power requirements for each component irrespective of its configuration or utilization. but the power consumption of a system is linearly correlated with its utilization. because of this, a huge gap exists between the data center’s anticipated power require\\xadment and the actual power required by its equipment. another option which is used is fixed de-rating where an arbitrarily percentage or number is subtracted from the nameplate value considering that the system’s faceplate rating is higher than its actual use. for example a 1,000 watt rated server would be de-rated by a fixed 20 percent which means you are assuming that it would consume 800 watts. however this is not true as its power consumption would be dependent on the utilization and estimated value most often is grossly inflated. as you might think, finding the correct percentage by which de-rating should be done is nearly impossible without any measurement tool. two servers of the same manufacturer and model can consume different powers because of the utilization.so if you thought you entered and wondered why none of the dt have been round to visit you, chances are your entry did not register with mr linky so you will need to do it again.frustrated

moment but it didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the novel. i was interested in knowing how j. c. and amy would trap the killer and how the killer managed to evade detection for so long. in some

virginia and kentucky documents of 1798-1800 spell out beyond any doubt that the final defense of freedom in the american system is the people acting in their only constitution-making identity, that

ability to shape shift his positions on any number of issues or topics, depending what audience he’s talking to at the time, he’s worked hard to put himself into a corner on lending even a pittance of

getting cheese from the remnant or manager special box at bloomingfoods. the cheeses i’ve gotten recently are goat gouda, cocoa dusted cardona, and kentucky blue cheese. the remnant section is great because it gives you a chance to try a cheese you may not normally. it also allows you to have an expensive cheese for a fraction of the cost and without the fear of it going moldy in the fridge. plus, if you’re cooking for one, you can make a small chunk of cheese last a for a few meals. if you’ve never had cardona before, i would suggest looking for it. it’s apparently an artisanal goat cheese from wisconsin. the creator of it got the idea from one of his favorite sandwiches- a piece of swiss cheese and a hershey bar on bread. i can barely detect the cocoa in this cheese, fortunately. anyway, i know a lot of people are leery to buy food that is marked down to sell. i’ve never had a problem, though, and it certainly beats paying full price.the sharks are lurking. why?

tentacles are actually quite soft to the touch and make it even more exotic in appearance. once red, these peel off easily with the skin which is a little woody, but pliable. you can break the skin

i found it to be a little bit melon-like but with the texture of a ripe grape. it sort of reminds me of a lychee, but not many people have tried that either so i don’t know if that helps. it doesn’t really drip juices, but seems like it should. depending on the ripeness of the fruit, it can vary in sweetness, but i’ve yet to taste one that gives an unripe sensation; however, an overripe one can seem a little bit fermented. these are fun, but maybe a little too extreme to be seen regularly in a kid’s lunchbox. they can seem expensive, but there’s very little waste and it’s not like you’ll eat dozens of them. it’s a fun treat in the world of interesting fruit.the night involved, apart from the drinking and socialising, several catwalk shows that allowed the models to show just why we need

you have in life, the major ones that is, are hard to grasp sometimes. they seem so far away, like we come so far only to go even further and it always seem just out of reach. today, you need to stop looking at where the goal is, but where you are and be proud of how far you come. for example, my business, four years ago it was looking on the verge of death and we were pretty scared here. one by one new clients came in and every month we got better, then every year we became more stable, till finally this year we got too much work and needed to grow. we are still not where we want to be, but i will take where we are and proud of what we did to make it.there isn’t much of this going on in today’s world! there is a lot of fixin’ our thoughts on things that are none of these. you hear parents yelling at their kids for foul language, when the kids get it from their parents; you see people at work trying to get by with whatever they can, instead of working to the fullest of their ability; society is full of pornography – not only the hard stuff that wrecks marriages and families, but soft porn, watched on tv, seen at the movies, displayed on magazine pages until we become immunized to its effects; fidelity in relationships or marriages is thrown out the window – after all, if it’s kept hidden, it’s ok, right?; violence in video games, movies, loss of life taken lightly – we are honoring the horrors that our military face on a regular basis – things that mess with their heads for the rest of their lives; bodies are thrown from one lover to the other for instant gratification; babies are ripped from their mother’s womb, deemed an inconvenience from a sexual act that most likely should not have taken place anyhow; deceit is prevalent all around as times are hard and people fear for their survival, yet refuse to let god handle it all; lying is used to get us out of anything we don’t want to deal with; rage runs rampant from the highways to our homes. the list goes on and on….who chooses when to fall for affectionbloemfontein - seven police officers and four civilians have been arrested for stealing 20 plasma television sets at an accident scene, free

chancellor building. the german garrison at berlin were contesting every block with the soviets but there were more soviets with combat training and far fewer germans, the germans fought with fanaticism born of fear and desperation, the soviet reprisals against the german civilians were well documented when german troops earlier had recaptured some german territory in vistula, the gang rape and executions were documented by photo\\'s and survivor eye witnesses. the german troops fought to buy time for the civilians to escape and of the false hope of all the wonder weapons and

where a foreigner called judy is planning to get married to a japanese lad. his family, and especially his grandfather, is opposed. basically, the whole volume traces an arc towards her final acceptance by his family. but the clever bit is that the story echoes the relationship between rita and masataka taketsuru, the founder of the nikka whisky (of which more here). taketsuru\\'s marriage to rita, a scottish woman, was at first not welcomed by his family (or her\\'s) but they lived out their lives together in japan. the story of rita and masataka is introduced near the end of the manga and resonates with the modern couple\\'s experience.the author of this poem, speaking as one of those who have returned from the babylonian exile, depicts for us with great poetic skill and power a typical scene of the captivity.jude must address some false teachers and there are teachers who pervert the grace of god to sensuality.pastor maldonado: it’s an unbelievable feeling winning my first

different than a bad habit. a bad habit is a single behaviour that you repeat regardless of the knowledge that it is doing you no good. rhythm is how we have learned to flow through our days we don’t think about it, it just propels us along developing a bad rhythm is easier than you think. good or bad that rhythm you\\'ve developed is a comfort to you. i learned that way back in design school.

about one objective: assimilation. the sooner we get off the reserve, the sooner they push the land management agreement on us, & the sooner we accept these and start living in the cities or start selling our land then the agreements that were signed over a hundred years ago will be null and void. we as a people, with our aboriginal rights and treaty rights will cease to exist, and this would

(thank you, jesus!!) with hubby off working long hard days, i\\'ll have a lot more time on my hands to blog about my life and loves, instead of all the cuddling and watching episodes of \"chuck\" that i have been doing for the last month. ;)this is, of course, based on a neil gaiman novel (he’s also credited as producer). i am, mutatis mutandis, a fan of gaiman’s work, and the writers of stardust (vaughn and jane goldman) have worked hard to ensure it sits easily within the canon. gaiman’s schtick, to the extent that he has one, is to combine classic story themes and ideas with a modern, often knowing sensibility – taking them seriously but not often sending them up. but while it’s smart and funny, stardust is really lacking in the darkness it probably needs to convince as a genuine fairy tale – much of the time it’s desperately whimsical, occasionally bordering on the twee. it should really be as annoying as hell and the fact that it isn’t is to vaughn’s credit.our illnesses reflect imbalancestv host: forget about the shame for a moment – is it allowed or not?the court was told that on july 11, yildirim was working at coles in knox city in melbourne\\'s east when he saw the girl take a bottle of body spray from the store without paying.for those who would like to see the finished card, it will be in my next post.dig in with a fork.....or if you are patient, let cool completely on a rack and then lift up the ends of the parchment or foil liner, and transfer the brownies to a cutting board. cut into squares.steiermärker (c.1850)♥ l\\'occitane almond shower oil.we have small eggs at the moment - all our laying girls are new layers, so i used six small eggs. if you have large eggs, use four. add salt and pepper, about ½ cup of cream, ½ cup of grated hard cheese - i used cheddar, and all the ricotta. mix together then add the silverbeet and onions and mix again.1. in the cavity of each of the cleaned fish place 1 of each of the ingredients listed above and wrap tightly in the foil.she was right, as usual.because now i can click over to my email and answer just one more, switch to evernote and work just a little bit more, spend another second tweaking the page i put in dropbox, and then shame spiral my way onto facey face before my little eyes start to droop and ultimately my ipad smacks me in the face as i fall asleep. (seriously.)i am proud of the times when i was the only one who could put my boys in a sling, walk them gently around the neighborhood softly humming lullabies or show tunes, and get them to fall asleep. and i am proud that when we got back home, i would usually sit in a comfy chair and fall asleep myself with them still slung to my body, our breathing patterns falling in together.once the oven is up to temperature, bake for 15 minutes before reducing the heat to 150c and baking for 45 minutes more. cover the loaf with a sheet of foil for the last 15 minutes if it’s looking too brown.home ain’t a place that gold can buy or get up in a minute;callen radcliffe tjader, jr. a.k.a. cal tjader (july 16, 1925–may 5, 1982) was a latin jazz musician, though he also explored various other jazz idioms. unlike other american jazz musicians who experimented with the music from cuba, the caribbean, and latin america, he never abandoned it, performing it until his death.a crone, a nobodythank you, linda, for that insight into your work. i agree that lob has the potential for a wide audience (i certainly enjoyed it!), and would certainly recommend the treasure house. in fact, i\\'m off to read a bit more now...recently, nicole, our number one babysitter, invited us to her friends\\' house so that helen and mason could make a snowman, and we could have a mimosa break. i start with the invitation because nicole is that kind of awesome. in truth, i seriously cannot remember the last time grey and i actually hired nicole, but she has remained our friend. she has come over for chinese, and stopped by just to see our kids, and she brings them presents, and texts us greetings on birthdays and holidays. helen worships her. we\\'ve met her dad.i’m hoping the same is true this time.ironically, earl bostic\\'s signature tune, flamingo, wasn\\'t on that record. i only discovered it through the internet about a year ago and i think it is now my favourite track of all earl\\'s tracks - the ones that i have heard that is. it achieves the almost impossible feat of being wistful, boisterous and joyous at one and the same time.............. and entirely thrilling!ii. focusing attention on oppression in the remaining unreformed communist governmentsin a 6 qt crockpot (or smaller if you have and want to use it and your steaks will fit. mine were frozen so not able to be mushed around!) layer steaks. put one layer down, cover with about 1/2 of the can of manwich sauce, top with other steaks and top them with the rest of the can. around the edges of the meat, pour the can of beef broth in. sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon onion powder & mushrooms.so who\\'s lee schrager and why is his name bigger than mine on the book cover? lee is the founder and director of the sobe festival and, more recently, the new york wine & food festival, coming up on its fourth year. lee is one of the most energetic, most creative people i know. not only are his festivals tons of fun, they raise millions of dollars for good causes. lee is connected, i\\'m sure, to two of every five people on the planet; at last count he had almost 7,000 people in his blackberry. so when he asked me to write the festival cookbook, i was thrilled.the dark moon phase is also best for reversing spells (always be sure there is one there to begin with).he said the city needs to be part of the “second industrial revolution,” producing green products within its borders.my baby is turning three tomorrow. i can\\'t believe it. the time has flown by, yet it feels like ages ago that i held that little, calm bundle in my arms. having him sick reminds me that i won\\'t get to hold him like this much longer. he is already so long!4 sprigs thyme or 1t dried thymethe barking barddid you kill it?some are arrested for ‘being witnesses to other incidents, one was arrested for crimen injuria’which he denies took place. what they all have in common is that they were put in holding cells with large crowds of hardened black criminals who then preceded to gang-rape them. some of these men also reported that the black police egged these rapists on to rape them… to ‘teach the white man a lesson’.in addition, according to an emarketer report, u.s. local online ad spending is also expected to grow, anywhere from 8% to 18% annually. so if the publication has a local website, that may also be a viable spot for advertising.the problem with the second statistic is that it is very clearly illogical. agents earn their income from commissions on sales--i.e., they get paid only if they sell something. if agents sold only 1 in every 100 manuscripts they represented, they couldn\\'t make enough money to keep their doors open--except maybe the disreputable ones who charge fees. (nor, with so few sales, is it likely that trade publishers would be able to churn out over 300,000 new titles a year in the usa alone.) and imagine the work load, if for every success you also had to market 99 duds! no agent will manage to sell every single manuscript--but no agent could possibly remain in business with such a high failure rate.may i take this second to express my hatred for flag ceremony?as i said, it was initially hard for me to envision a zombie novel as a romance. however, either marion’s writing changed my perception or love really does affect us all – living or undead. marion can relate to our uncertainties about a romantic zombie. “i didn’t want to sanitize him into something i called a zombie,” marion says. “you watch him kill people and eat people and do horrific things zombies do. there’s a germ of change in there, so you hear him give his distaste for things but this is what we do.i really don\\'t know anything about her life, other than that she most likely was english, because this first edition was published in london.you find yourself in such a situation, you should not be need consciousi need god….we took off on time and headed south to saigon. we were on the right side of the plane, and we could see a very large and very dark thundercloud off to our right. the pilot was making a slight turn to the left in order to go around the thunderhead. as we traveled along, we enjoyed an absolutely stunning sunset behind the dark clouds. along the way we also saw lightening in the clouds, which made me wonder if this leg of our trip through vietnam would also have an element of excitement. alas, nothing happened, and we landed safely at the ho chi ming city airport.i kept the card simple and used use a stamp from my one & only \\'stampin\\' up\\' set. i added some \\'doodles\\' to the cup cake case and faux stitching around the edge of the card.glendale, arizona was the destination place for this move.tiramisu: 8brittany and vaido recently renovated a 1000 square foot chefs kitchen in a nearby business park, with an office and a small dining room for tastings in the front.this 3 month internship program is completely online through digital platforms dealing with live multicasting: cable television, streaming, virtual universes, augmented reality, mobile media and social media.so the inducted musical maestros, in no particular order, are:“not unlike hitler’s later nazification programs for german youth, exemplified in the hitlerjugend, the young turks now launched a program of nationalist indoctrination an paramilitary training for turkish youth.” (the burning tigris, pg 163).cards left 12 runners stranded.makes about 3 servings, more if served with brown rice.thank you orson scott card for sharing your creativity – excellent series with excellent characters.the short story i read was the machine stops by e.m. forster (which i believe is available for free online and in e-book format). i read it as part of my ongoing interest in dystopian and apocalyptic literature, and while forster has some disturbing insights into future life that could easily be applied in today’s world, the story doesn’t have much in the way of plot or characters; it’s more of a platform for forster to get across some of his ideas. it’s still worth reading, though, if you are interested in how authors envision the future.update: the covey\\'s brewhouse equipment has been sold to a start-up brewpub in bangalore, india, and fulton will be consulting with them for a few months as they get operations underway.down it came, along by the byre, and across the yard, and the pair inside heard the calling and crying.“bless me, father, for i have sinned. this is my first confession.”when he arrived at his smallholding, he was shot in the head, said du plessis. \"he even fell on the bag of potatoes i gave him.\"however, these cuts are usually much cheaper by the pound than other, less tough, cuts (at least that’s the case around here). therefor i thought i should find some good ways to make “summer dishes” out of these cuts.like a lot of other bands, they straddle the line between pagan metal and black metal (if it\\'s really a line at all), using very few folk elements. they play at a mid-pace for black metal, allowing their very catchy riffs to sink in (see especially \"waldeinsamkeit\"), while the drums never go into blast-beat territory, instead opting for a fast but steady pace with some fills. most of the vocals are rasped, but there are some more melodic vocal styles in here as well. which brings me to some of the surprises.unfortunately, though, it\\'s sacha\\'s head that catches the attention of the picky baron (he was rather taken by his pronounced serbian nose). removing it with a pair of specially designed head clippers, the baron and his lab assistant leave nicholas unconscious on the side of the road next to sacha\\'s now headless body. groggy and confused (he was out cold before his pal\\'s head was chopped off), nicholas wanders off to meet with baroness katrin frankenstein, an eyebrowless vixen played by monique van vooren (sugar cookies). yeah, that\\'s right, he has an appointment to see the baron\\'s wife and sister (they have two kids together) at their castle. you see, before the head lopping incident, nicholas and the baroness were constantly running into one another. and since her brother won\\'t impale her vaginal tract with his aristocratic penis anymore, she decides to hire the strapping stableboy as her new man servant/boy-toy.the plan wasn\\'t entirely abandoned during our trip - we picked up locally-produced foods at a couple of farmer\\'s markets, co-ops and even a goat dairy, not to mention a variety of products that i brought home as edible souvenirs. so, i hope you\\'ll join me in the next few weeks as i revisit some of the more memorable food adventures of our wild west wanderings. coming up first: north platte noodles, a roadtrip dinner do-over.we get the mtv-staged piece about how she got pregnant (seventh grade biology, ya\\'ll). apparently they only used protection \"once or twice\" because it was awkward and weird to talk about. note: this is probably a sign you should not be having sex with someone. just sayin\\'. the lack of protection is somehow his fault because he should\\'ve just, like, put one on or something, ya know? (teenage girls! do not ever, ever, ever, ever, ever depend on the guy to take care of pregnancy protection. he is not the one who will get pregnant)!he stepped out of the car and looked skyward. it’s about forty-five degrees, sky full of stars, no clouds, but snow,” he thought. he peeled off his fingerless gloves before reaching into the air to catch a flake as it descended. he looked at it, but light was scarce. he checked up to see that the nearest street light was four houses away, then glanced again up into the starry night. he watched star after star disappear as if a black blanket was being pulled across the night sky, eventually leaving an empty ceiling. he blindly reached through the open car window while watching where the stars had been only seconds ago. he clicked on the spotlight that was mounted just above his side view mirror and held his palm in front of the beam.yes, sir.auhm is the name of my solo project.

hourly is $25 (usd) and those with a network of clients earn significantly more. but if i were to come in and say $15 an hour, a very liveable wage here, would severely hurt everyone else and my future prospects. it would create the expectation that writing is only worth that much, which if i’m writing 1000 words an hour equates to 6.66 cents a word. i earn that for a short submission to some of the local publications.no more death sting no more sufferingthose are just a few of the questions i hear from my colleagues on a regular basis. apart from a general techno-sensibility, i have a bit

you so far, it can be done.\\ufeffhaving seen so much of the changes that have occurred in the last couple of years, and especially just recently, i thought i would give you some heads up on why the mortgage underwriter and processor keep asking for more documentation. it seems like a mountain of information that is needed to get a loan to approval these days and we all know why. let me remind you, yet again, though it seems excessive, it is necessary to fully implement due diligence and determine whether someone really does qualify for a loan. the underwriter usually gets blamed for declining a loan, regardless of what the issues are and just recently something was written online about real estate agencies requesting less strict underwriting guidelines. after all we have been through as a nation, let alone the many homeowners who could face never owning another home, how could anyone request something like this?i will give thanks to you, o lord, with all my heart,i didn’t know of any reference to the wild man within their folklore, however, right before my book was published, i got word a big thicket preserve ranger that people on the reservation have been reporting the ape-like creature sightings to the ranger, who is an indian. they were telling him about it.write what you understand is the one that works best for me. if you understand the situation, your story will be consistent, if you understand the characters, you’ll be able to create a well developed personality, if you understand the emotions, you will be able to create human experience that you reader is looking for, the journey that makes them feel things. that’s what write what you know means to me.the da\\'s theo coetzee said: \"moe shaik is deeply involved in faction fights within the ruling party, and we must therefore assume that his appointment will further politicise the nia.\"now, why they didn\\'t cover this in the documentary, i don\\'t know...it\\'d make for some pretty sweet cgi. again, the earth was already pretty geologically active prior to this impact, but definitely way moreso afterwards.chapter 2 of liquids and gasses has lots of fun water experiments. because the weather was not conducive to being in it, we used the bathtub. we punched holes in a milk jug and watched the water shoot out father from the bottom hole than the top hole. we also poked a hole in the bottom of one cup and the side of another to demonstrate that pressure is in all directions. i thought this would be rather simplistic, but i underestimated boys\\' fascination with water.g’day.cap

month makes a good argument as to one cause. agricultural subsidies are primarily directed towards a few crops, including corn and soybeans. this makes the goods derived from these crops, such as high fructose corn syrup, cheaper, while making other produce, such as carrots, oranges, etc more expensive. this means that healthier food ends up being a luxury good.6. the voyage/have you heard? pt.iiseeing that peter sellers released it in 1957 perhaps someone should have a word with steptoe and son and tell them that only last year music copyright laws were extended from fifty to seventy

ladies joining our design team this week. they are both extremely talented and will bring a new and fresh approach to the midnight madness sketch challenge. if you have never visited their blogs

there as soon as i could. i have photos to share that i\\'ll be uploading soon. what i will try to relate as well is the feeling of incredible love and hope that exists today for those on the forefront of fighting aids and discrimination for hiv+ people. what i learned about this disease, now in the 25th year since its discovery, shook me deeply and also made my eyes fill with tears of compassion for the people who live with this illness on some level daily.since she wasn\\'t here to try them on while they were being sewn, i kind of guessed on some things, so they\\'re not a perfect

these gorgeous red flowers this year. last summer none of my poincianas bloomed much at all, but that was probably as a direct result of the rather out-of-the-ordinary rain we received during our supposedly \\'dry\\' season. poincianas like the dry and they seem to bloom so much better when the dry season is very, very dry.i wouldn’t ever want to hurt them, but sometimes i wish i was the kind of person who would just do it upfront and not really care. but then again, that i don’t do cruel things like that is just about the only salvageable aspect of my personality, so i wouldn’t actually do it even if i could.ideas alone cannot have any effect. they are simply information and evil people know this. that is why conditions are set up in the physical world to empower those ideas and hence trick the other person into believing them. and let me specify here again that empowered ideas are not ones that the evil people can present as some potent weapon being thrown at the victim from them. evil people have no mental powers. empowered ideas only means that lame ideas are presented at such time and in such a way as to find fertile soil. the victim is upholding beliefs together with changes to their body function, which occur simultaneously with the ideas presented, so as to make those ideas appear as powerful ideas. they are not. it is all about deceit and really a dramatic puppet show stitched together, a cut and paste exercise. with this in mind we can then appreciate that to generate barrier or resistance cells in the body (what doctors call cancer cells) there needs to be harmful ideas presented in the mind that are empowered because of the condition of the targeted person/ the victim; and for all that to occur when the targeted person is angry and hostile. when a person is angry and hostile they will hold a misguided volition with respect to those ideas as to struggle with them. however finding no clear and definable aggressor with which to struggle, which is their plan a, they go to plan b. in plan b their volition becomes the desire to build a barrier or shield for protection against the mysterious aggressor. the theatre of war seems to be in the body, so the barrier that can be built can only ever be a cell barrier, which of course grow bigger and bigger the harder they struggle and fight until a mass is formed. this mass doctors call cancer.barn swallow 32john and i talked several times before i could finally convince him to come out and see the house and the ongoing remodel. over time, he told us stories about how special the house was for him all those years before; how it changed his life. he was only 28 years old when he designed it, as a “moonlighting” job. he described how he rocked his kids to sleep with his foot while he was drawing the plans, late at night. (plans we now have, drawn with pencil on a rice paper of some kind.) john explained that the house changed his career, gave him the momentum he needed to start his own firm. he spoke veryas quickly as our snow came, it left and here it is january tenth and it\\'s still fifty degrees outside. tonight the kids played outside while i cooked dinner which doesn\\'t even seem possible. i asked jon if this was some sort of global warming and he gave me this whole run down about the jet stream and how it\\'s all going to change when a low pressure system comes in to i don\\'t know...change the stream? god i feel stupid when people talk about jet streams.don’t take our word for it. here’s what the late richard rorty, one of the most prominent post-modern philosophers of the 20th century, said on the subject:i know what i need to do, in fact i have written it all down and have a recipe book to pull from ever meal that i need to create, cook and eat so that my body is fueled correctly. i know how to workout and in fact i crave it but with my current stress levels and lack of what i would call free time to get out there and bust ass, i am as i stated struggling to get back in the game as it were. am i still riding my bike? absofuckinloutly! that is something that i won\\'t stop doing as its one of the things in life where i find pure joy but i am not in fact riding enough. i haven\\'t ridden during the week in months, my only riding takes place on the weekend with a riding buddy and that\\'s approximately 20 to 25 miles at a go which is as i said not enough.but more than the art, i was amazed to see the style of the women and men… all the fashion was amazing, and people are so elegant and confident, women are beautiful and men are so hot!! it’s too bad that most of my pictures from that time were lost when my notebook was stollen… so all i’ve got left is a few pics, but not enough to show some street style, so i just chose these about some styles i was wearing.and mouth with myriad subtleties.after a bit, she wanted to go on the swings. not the big girl swings but the baby ones. the one ashlin was in last time we were there. fine. ashlin is staying in the stroller. i wasn’t allowed to push her though. weird kid. eventually she wanted to get out, so we did the wiggle, wiggle, wiggle dance to get her out of the too-small swing. the slightly wet sand under the swings was the next source of gravity, and she crouched down to grab a handful. and peed her pants.naturally, i assumed she meant to say, \"liberty won\\'t help me clean.\" the two girls had

property. as rent rises, so too do food prices. supermarkets need to charge more to maintain inventory, and hawkers need to pay their stall rent. the practice of subletting hawker stalls is especially problematic: that’s when a stall holder pays maybe $700 a month for the stall, but charges someone $2000 a month to operate it. wave at holland village, people.the most chaste daughter of maharaja drupada and partly an incarnation of goddess saci, the wife of indra. maharaja drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage yaja. by his first offering, dhrstadyumna was born, and by the second offering, draupadi was born. she is therefore the sister of dhrstadyumna, and she is also named pancali. the five pandavas married her as a common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. maharaja yudhisthira begot a son named pratibhit, bhimasena begot a son named sutasoma, arjuna begot srutakirti, nakula begot satanika, and sahadeva begot srutakarma. she is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, kunti. during her birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called krsna. the same message also declared that she was born to kill many a ksatriya. by dint of her blessings from sankara, she was awarded five husbands, equally qualified. when she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. she was married with the pandavas during their exile in the forest, but when they went back home maharaja drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. she was well received by all the daughters-in-law of dhrtarastra. when she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by duhsasana to see her naked beauty, even though there were elderly persons like bhisma and drona present. she was a great devotee of lord krsna, and by her praying, the lord himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. a demon of the name jatasura kidnapped her, but her second husband, bhimasena, killed the demon and saved her. she saved the pandavas from the curse of maharsi durvasa by the grace of lord krsna. when the pandavas lived incognito in the palace of virata, kicaka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with bhima the devil was killed and she was saved. she was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by asvatthama. at the last stage, she accompanied her husband yudhisthira and others and fell on the way. the cause of her falling was explained by yudhisthira, but when yudhisthira entered the heavenly planet he saw draupadi gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet.gupta: \"what are all these diseases that you say are linked to sugar?\"- in spanish, describing words like cold¨ must match the gender of the word they describe, which is why words like ¨frio¨ (masculine) might suddenly become ¨fria¨ (feminine) instead if it is describing a word that is feminine. there are no logical rules about which words are masculine or feminine, so you can´t tell just by looking at them.comments/rts as ever welcomed, thanks for reading jx

that the summer matters site talks about are family time (though many families have two or are single-parent working and the summer doesn’t change that since the kids are still in the care of others during the day), childhood growth and development (which is currently ousted in favor of having children study more to boost standardized test scores) and the economy of seasonal communities (which really only matters if you’re among the top income brackets – we poor folks don’t really contribute much to the seasonal economy since we’re too busy worrying about budgeting this week’s grocery bill to plan a vacation to a touristy hot spot).so, do you guys feel that you finally understand what voice is? do you have questions? what are your thoughts? your suggestions? do you think people are born

conversion services consider a linked table of contents to be an enhanced service, others take the term to mean embedded audio and video files, while then there are those like myself who think that an enhanced ebook is internal hyperlinks within the ebook to a different section – a footnotes section or another part of the ebook that offers an explanation – and external hyperlinks. (in the interest of full disclosure, i have to admit that probably 90% if the ebooks that i build could be considered enhanced.)we spent some time tracing the bakerloo line, and some time on the 6 route, and passed the roger gracie academy of brazilian jujitsu (no, nor did we…) then we were back on familiar territory as we went down ladbroke grove and over the canal, where we just glimpsed some passing boats. then we were into the car park for ‘sylvia’s sainsbury’s’. from the bus, we could not see the memorial garden to the dead of the paddington railway disaster of 1999 though we know it’s there somewhere. we looped round st charles’ hospital, where sylvia spent a few weeks in the 1990s. i’m sure it’s cleaner now than it was then: it is impossible to imagine it being dirtier…as a result, as many as 35 new hindi films entailing investments of over rs 200 crore of investments will now be able to hit screens soon. these include yashraj film’s new york starring katrina kaif and john abraham, kaminay (shahid kapoor, priyanka chopra), kambakht ishq, life partner and sikander, among others.garnets –jerusalem –early pre- indian uprising single.it really does make one wonder, does it not, wtf bloomberg is doing listening to jerks like hintz on the subject of a firm mired in conflict of interest litigation, when the man himself has an ma degree in the practical application of conflict of interest. but such is the nature of banking business these days, this will go down as merely another example of the slog’s “remorseless cynicism” when dealing with wall street.andrea is an assistant pastor’s wife and stay-at-home-mommy in brooklyn, new york. she is serving the lord with her husband ben while they prepare to plant a new church in new york city. her daughter elaine is an adorable 2 years old, and nolan is a rambunctious 9 month old bundle of trouble! andrea also enjoys blogging at random issues, polished palaces, and doable diapers. she is a recovering pinterest addict, loves snow storms, walks in the park, starbucks, a good read, playing the piano, and anything paper-crafting.satyavachan!and i realized that this visible invisible bondfunny the things you remember from college.....story ever told. the question is really, what do you want to be successful at?after losing everyone she loves, concert pianist liesl bower has nowhere to go but to escape into her music. searching for the peace she usually finds in her concertos and sonatas, liesl can’t shake the feeling that she is being haunted by her past . . . and by someone following her. when she spots a familiar and eerie face in the audience of a concert she’s giving for the president in washington, dc, the scariest day of her life comes back to her with a flash.1 1/2 cups of unbleached white flourso...now on to the positive part of monday morning! my girls having fun in the snow...well my big girls anyway :) miss maggie was not to thrilled about the cold and being wrapped up! for now i think she is happier playing in a warm house!in this economy, spending your advertising dollars always involves wise and strategic decisions. visibility is critical and doing it the right way is important. when assessing where you want value and where you want the visibility, you have to consider the newest sports franchise in the triangle, the raleigh roughriders.after so much success with my writing skills, i decided to try my hand in other aspects of writing. though not so good with most aspects of it(like grammar, punctuation’s etc) i got praise from lots of people and that praise was enough to inspire me to continue.in the fourth private meeting of the council, held on may 15, same time and same place, the bishops of the united states agreed to ask the holy see for permission, in all the dioceses of the country, to add the word \"immaculate\" in the orations and preface of the divine office and mass of the conception of mary; and also to add in the litany of the blessed virgin the invocation: \"queen, conceived without sin, pray for us.\"how we see ourselves on the outside is directly related to how we see ourselves on the inside.the reason for the award is to recognize and promote other blogs. i enjoy reading sewing blogs so it will be very easy for me to nominate other blogs for the awesome award.weight: 120 lbs!!!!!!!! gained 2 lbs!!but there is evidence of significant improvements in school nutrition.so what does freedom look like in our house?brugge pookamolotha, theodota (theotimus?) with senani’m headed off to toledo on business… yeah, nothing says happy valentine’s day like a trip to toledo without my sweetie.

thing we noted during our stay in ireland was how laid back everyone was. it was refreshing to note that no one was interested in getting us out of a restaurant or pub so that they could turn the table over. throughout our journey we were never rushed and allowed to sit and enjoy our dinner at each establishment and were never rushed out the door. it was refreshing when you consider the united states where everything is about getting people in and out of a restaurant with no consideration of the flow of the meal.“do i look like i’m joking?” reilly had to admit he looked pretty convinced

atlantic ocean as a backdrop. so i decided to keep things simple. i have a personalized aisle runner to mark the aisle and to protect my dress from the ground, my mother is going to help me decorate a wedding arch for the ceremony to take place under, and i made flower cones to hang at the end of each row of seats for an added bit of decoration to my aisle. i opted to make flower cones because they are different from standard pew bows, and i think they add a nice touch. they are also extremely easy to make and cost effective. for eight flower cones, i purchased eight sheets of cardstock at 25 cents a sheet, and four spools of ribbon, on clearance, for 97 cents each for a grand total of just under six dollars. my inspiration for making flower cones is from this site, although i ended up making my own subtle changes.it would be redundant of me to point out the obvious evil of the “modern” progressive crusade to save the world from itself, when the political correctness plague with which this movement is infected, is currently so pervasive at every level of society. it is an infection of psychological origin, a contagious mental illness, and it is spread by the main stream media through dissemination of certain key phrases that mutate into gross distortions of basic fact each and every time they are repeated. the carriers of this disease are those lonely souls who follow societal trends in order to fit in, and who desire nothing more than to be on the winning team. they make it a point to know all the buzzwords associated with the cause they support, but not the origin of the sound-bytes they parrot. they are quick to criticize opposition to their dogma, and resort to ad hominid attacks when confronted with irrefutable fact. they are unaware of their illness, and perceive anyone that disagrees with their view as uninformed, and generally all the more needful of their “help”.budweiser is fit for a mates house party or at a club, fits with a guys image, little in terms of taste to offend or surprise the consumer and hard to spill so long as its kept in the bottle. budvar is a little more reserved and almost an opposite in terms of setting. this would be more acceptable at a dinner table or in a nice pub with a few salty snacks to help it go down. this beer also has much more flavour, less carbonisation and is far more complimented when poured into a glass.a fter 20 years of lobbying and planning and four years of hard labor, the queens midtown tunnel, linking manhattan and long island city, queens, opened on november 15, 1940 to the public. at

(sra#103).brasserie de la senne / de zenne brouwerij taras boulbano one should be more surprised that the tories take money from rich people, who then get the ear of the government, than that the tories, and their liberal clones, last week, pushed through a budget that also favoured the rich, and further attacked ordinary working people. society is not divided into just two classes, but it is divided into two great \"class camps\", as marx put it in the communist manifesto. that is the camp of capital and the camp of labour. the liberal-tories represent the former, and labour should represent the latter. there is nothing wrong, or surprising, then in the rich, and the representatives of capital, giving money to the liberal-tories in return for them pursuing policies in their interests, any more than there is anything wrong with workers, through their union subscriptions, or through individual subscriptions, paying money to labour for the same reason.though as this is taught to be possible to do, you are also said to likely bump into sinister beings who will try to mislead you from the path. these teachings explain how to transform yourself into a spiritual being and every spiritual being that exists is said to have done this work, have transformed themselves into beings of light. the sinister beings are also said to have made themselves into the way they are, have transformed themselves into beings of darkness. and when you call on a master in the astral, the sinister beings are said to sometimes come to you, trying to pretend that they are the master and try to mislead you. i have heard stories of this and people say that sometimes it is very obvious, like the sinister being is trying to look like the master, but fails so hard to do so. anyway, there are recitations that one can do which are said to get rid of any sinister being. this can be used to get rid of them and also to check whether or not you are encountering a spiritual being or if it is a sinister being. as sinister beings are said to disappear when doing these recitations, the spiritual beings do not.this just is not the way to follow up a classic film - it isn\\'t done in the same

and see and feel everything they did. it came as a rude shock when at 5 they were already, in a sense, on their own and experiencing life without me. it was at that moment i knew that my role had

traffic policeman is a common sight on every crossing. oprah winfrey, when she visited india recently and travelled across mumbai, and later between delhi and agra, wondered what they were for. the mystery is yet to be solved. it is somewhat like figuring out why there is a queen in england. i believe they are there because it is a tradition to have traffic lights (four) and traffic policeman (one) – a convention, without which the city roads would look less like roads, and more like lanes or highways. in some parts of india the traffic cop cuts a sorry figure, being abused and ignored; at others he is an evil character, stopping vehicles randomly, for his ‘cut’.

and employer fraud. mismatches in the e-verify databases also leave employers still vulnerable to immigration enforcement even if they rely on the program to sort out whether their employees are

necessary to draw a distinction between mr. kim’s substantive qualifications and the procedure by which he was selected. substantively, although lacking in either financial or diplomatic experience, dr. kim is in certain respects an interesting choice because of his lifelong dedication to improving the health of the very poor in the global south, as well as his training in medicine and phd in anthropology. he has had extensive relevant experience on the ground, and in working with ngos (he co-founded the widely admired partners in health) and in institutional settings (for some years he directed the hiv/aids program for the world health organization) and has been president of dartmouth university for the past three years, although stirring controversy during his brief period of administrative tenure. it may be still wondered whether dr. kim understands sufficiently the economic dimensions of world bank policy to enjoy the respect of the professional staff, and might have been more appropriately chosen to head an enhanced program of the bank devoted to health and poverty. overall, still, the substantive case for the appointment is relatively strong, although the two opposing candidates, both former finance ministers of developing countries, certainly had equally impressive substantive résumés and ethical profiles, and were plausible choices for this position.then

devices and doing what she was told. then came time for the eye drops. i had attempted to prepare the staff about katie. when i called to make the appointment i had told them that she has autism and that she does not like having her face/head messed with. i told them that putting in the eye drops to dilate her eyes was going to be an issue. “oh don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” well, you haven’t dealt with my kid. when we arrived at the appointment, i reminded them, “my daughter has autism and she doesn’t like having her face messed with. the eye drops are going to be a problem.” again, “oh, don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” *sigh* when it came time for the eye drops, i told the assistant, “katie has autism. she does not like having her face messed with. this is going to be a challenge.” “oh, it will be fine. i work with kids all the time.” what happened next was straight out of a time passed where they tortured patients at hospitals… they laid her back in the chair and i could see her beginning to panic. then, the assistant came to stand over her and tried talking to her. the hands came up to the face and the yelling/crying began. katie is a very vocal and verbal child. she is fully capable of relating to those around her how much she dislikes a situation, and she did just that. i stood back and watched in absolute horror/vindication. i tried to tell them! i mostly stood by to see the man struggle with the situation, but i finally took pity on him and i went over to help by holding her hands down. i told her over and over again, “let the man do his job. you need to have these eye drops to make sure your eyes are healthy.” all the while getting louder and louder. she was also getting louder and louder. i can only imagine what the people in the other exam rooms were thinking. now, since her hands were pinned down, she scrunched her eyes up. the poor man (kid really) tried to get the drops in. he had us go out to the waiting room while the drops did their stuff. poor katie was all red from crying and she was all sweaty from the stress the whole situation had caused her. but, she was happy to be done with it all and enjoyed looking at all the glasses. after about twenty minutes, the man (kid) came back to check her eyes… we had to try the drops again. the first go round didn’t take. *fuck*riding carrouselsmix

and, thanks to the internet, blogging and twitter, i’m able to prove myself an assmerican over and over again, daily if the opportunity arises.these were developed prior to 1934 and came into

seen as they twirl around the dance floor of the casino.i wanted to concentrate on all the good things i have in my life - the wonderful friends and family, the great places i have been and also the simple pleasures of my life. and i couldn\\'t go past mentioning my beautiful husband kevin. most of you probably know that kev and i met after he responded to an ad i placed in the connections section of the local sunday paper. that was 17 years ago this april. he was one of over 200 respondents and he was my 17th date (i am nothing if not persistent!). i first met him when he came to my place for a coffee - not the wisest thing to do, but my brother adam was lurking in the background. he knocked on the door and adam welcomed him and handed him a beer. kev said later that he was desperately hoping he was at the right house (grin). we chatted for a few hours and i headed off to a nursing night shift. after that it was just one of those things. we kept ringing each other and catching up and six months later we were living together. he was nothing like the man i imagine i would spend my life with, but at the same time he was everything i needed. he was (and is) calm, kind and genuine. there is no pretence. he says what he means and doesn\\'t tend to sugarcoat things. most of all he loved me for all my faults and foibles - he never (and has never) asked me to change and he wanted the same things from life that i did (and still does).we are a part of society and hence, it is compulsory for me to be an active participant in the activities of the society. and this is one of the many things i was trying to avoid in the last many years.place all ingredients in jar and cover with vinegar--the more vinegar you add, the more diluted (and less spicy) they will be. let

doesn\\'t fall apart.have you ever wished you weren\\'t good at something? it took a long time for me to understand and accept that most of my talents are domestic. my mother lost my father when she was 27, and she taught both my brother and i that we should know how to do certain things for ourselves. i know how to change my own tire. my brother was admonished with \"no woman ever shot her husband while he was washing dishes.\" but my mother was disappointed that i didn\\'t enjoy many of the foods that she did. (if ground beef, chicken breasts, and cream of mushroom soup were made illegal tomorrow, she\\'d have a difficult time making tomorrow night\\'s dinner, put it like that.) she was also highly critical whenever i did attempt to help--i could never stir fast enough or slice thinly enough. she made it clear that i should put more effort into learning to cook, and spoke of how backwards it was that my brother was more enthusiastic about it than i was.i know that i’m being abrupt approaching you.“the federal government has introduced prpp legislation that will be passed shortly,” the letter states.

medium sized businesses, can reap the benefits of a low-cost, accessible pension plan.”after three years of searching, and now 21 years old, i still had not found what i was looking for. i heard about a course called silva mind control, which was invented by jose silva. i took a friend along with me and we signed up for the course. i had no idea what i was getting into, but the flyer that i had looked at promised me that i would have the ability to diagnose and heal those who were sick. we were told to lie down on the floor and visualize a workroom. then we were told to create imaginary counselors to help us in this workroom. my counselors were jesus, curly, of the three stooges, and the lone ranger. lol! i figured that each of them could be trusted. much to my amazement they would appear with me in my imaginary workroom. we have discussed some of what this is in the pages of this book. i was being indoctrinated into the occult, using meditation and what is known as guided imagery to catapult me into the unseen world of the spirit.i’m not going to run and hide from the challenges set before me (not every day anyway)life is complicated.i wanted to buy the entire store

pakistan, and 52 percent through the northern distribution network (ndn). the us plan is to transit 75 percent of all non-lethal supplies through the ndn. and 30 percent of the supplies, mostly lethal weapons, come by air through pakistani airspace. they have not placed restrictions of overflights.there are 24 hours in a day. that is just a fact. wishing there were more hours does not help or solve any problems. by using an “if only” wish, the house is excused of its messiness simply because it cannot help being messy because of the lack of time. the individual responsible for cleaning the house uses the “if only” to make himself or herself feel better about the lack of action taking place. this does not help anything.i wish i could say that the zan-gah stories are completely accurate, but my approach was not primarily archaeological; it was humanistic. zan-gah is about courage, brotherhood, and compassion, among other things. were prehistoric people compassionate? i doubt it. nevertheless, i tried to be accurate where it counted. i researched slings and hand fishing. i researched prehistoric twins, discovering that in some early societies twins were terribly frightening and killed immediately—and so was the mother (not the father). that information was important in the development of my plot. i had never actually been inside a cave, so i visited onondaga, one of the world\\'s great caves (my state of missouri is famous for them), and was overwhelmed by the experience. i took notes furiously. i was the only guy in the whole cave who was taking notes. some of them

wash.a dominar in the skorne empire who rose to power through politicking and corruption, rasheth is atypical of the skorne as a people. the skorne generally follow strict codes throughout their lives, almost all of which center around self-denial and drawing strength from pain. rasheth, though, is not a fan of any of that malarkey, and lives to indulge himself. having taken control of his house through shady deals and well-timed assassinations, rasheth is in a position of great power in the empire. his house has the best and most effective titan breeding methods in the entirety of skorne society. this has allowed rasheth to grow fat and rich. so much so that he can no longer move under his own power, and is carried everywhere by a team of agonisers. the only thing that has stopped any of the other skorne tyrants and dominars from moving against him is his effortless mastery of the skorne magic of mortitheurgy. no other skorne even comes close to rivaling his control of the arcane, and so he is safe, and free to grow as hedonistic and as wealthy as he can.what i did was anything current i\\'d keep in my home management binder and then once paid, i\\'d file it into the expanding file folder, but i realize i keep up to date with - what\\'s due when - easily by just making a note on my fabulous home management wall calendar instead! so then i just look at that and can easily check my expanding file folder to see any details (such as account number) if i need! though honestly my calendar has so much space i put the amount due and anything i need there most times already!thus one tiny group gets infallible protection, and the 93% get the crumbs. to rationalise that reality, wombats like milt friedman come along and explain how this is the only way to create

abysmal attempts at street performing, raka falls in love with seeta while for no real apparent reason, seeta falls in love with him. although to be fair he is probably the first person she has met who is as self-absorbed about his orphan status as she is, and their shared misery does create a bond. their wedding is set, as is geeta’s to dr ravi but of course the path of true love never runs that smoothly and there is still the confusion between the two sisters to sort out. although raka tries to save the day, in the end it’s geeta with a little help from her sister who proves that anything a bollywood hero can do, a heroine can do even better. it’s all totally crazy, over the top and hema seems to have an excellent time beating up all the bad guys in the fight scenes.and you can make a most excellent lobster roll at least as good as red’s – ask me for my recipe – at home for, at worst, half the price of red’ $14.95 and you won’t have to wait an hour in line sucking down

we are so distracted that we are unable to pay attention to any signs in our life, indicating that we are either on the right path or the wrong path, we can be sure that the truth will continue to do what it can to guide us. but if we continue to ignore the smaller signs indicating that we are not living in our truth, then those signs get bigger and will usually become more devastating, disrupting and painful.the flying monkeys were so happy for a new leader!a pitcher who hasn\\'t control hasn\\'t anything.she was cut out using my spellbinders circle nestabilities and then adhered onto

certain. it is set forever in the holy mind of god, and in your own. it is so far beyond all doubt and question that to ask what it must be is all the proof you need to show that you believe the contradiction that you know not what you cannot fail to know. is this a question, or a statement which denies itself in statement? let us not allow our holy minds to occupy themselves with senseless musings such as this.he writes that ‘until late tuesday-night they discussed strategies – and amongst the decisions taken were that regular protest meetings would be held outside the south african

this set the stage for a lesson on the real taxes imposed on the colonist.i really wish i had brought my camera to school on my birthday. my darling (and very sneaky) 6th graders found out it was my birthday, and they threw me my first ever surprise party! they all hid under their desks after we came back from lunch, and they jumped out and yelled \"surprise!\" they even brought cake and presents!! my favorite part was the sweetest handmade card they presented to me after the party. it started out as just one folded piece of paper, but more kids wanted to sign it so they stapled more paper onto the back. the notes my students wrote me almost made me cry! they were all so sweet.okay, i know i said i was going to ignore the political realm today, but then i found this video on funny or die and had to reconsider...born to a wealthy and privileged family in 1889, in one of the most exclusive communities in american history, tuxedo park, dorothy draper was the first to “professionalize” the interior design industry by establishing, in 1923, the first interior design company in the united states, something that until then was unheard of, and also at a time when it wasi rarely visit gadget\\'s place because i despair at the way they think of us. i could go and argue my corner, (particularly on this thread), but i won\\'t. it\\'s like teaching a donkey to sing: it\\'s a waste of time and it just annoys the donkey....of myself.18.frank blevins + his tar heel rattlers - i\\'ve got no honeythis is a touching and beautiful expose piece, full of incredible scenery and warm sentiments. as the olympic games are drawing near to a close, it is no small thing to take a moment and say thank you to not only such generous hosts, but our finest neighbor. oh canada!

to make this card, i printed the frame on white cardstock, then layered it on to a piece of the hot pink cardstock. i then added a hot pink oval to the center, where i stamped the greeting in versafine black ink. the patterned papers are from my scraps stash. i used one of my border punches by fiskars to liven up just the corners of the polka dotted paper. in keeping with the challenge, i added a little floral and ribbon embellishment, with a pearl-topped hat pin tucked into the center of the ribbon behind the flowers.we pulled up at an upscale apartment complex in a well-to-do area of the city. there are a lot of young professionals in this city. people around my age with careers, salaries, pensions, car payments and regular apoinments; set on paths with far more definite outcomes than the one i am still riding out.thou common friend, that\\'s without faith or love,president of the united way receives a $375,000 base salary (u. s. funds),i also spent a little money to replace our laundry hamper. this thing had 2-3 tears in it, and was being held together with zip ties. i will hand it to my hubby for the creativity of helping the hamper last as long as it did, but i am so happy to replace it with a $10 one from target that matches our room and style a bit better. i\\'m not really counting this as spending money, because lets face it, we were going to have to replace it anyways, well see for your self.prodigy firestarter ukspinning plates by richie mccaffery (pamphlet)the beautiful paper is by prima markerting (madeline collection).03 ride natty ride (nonpalidede)-glug of olive oilthe san antonio riverwalk is a blast!

(she did not know it then, but many years later she would be one of those ladies.)well, unless he’s bernie madoff, he’s not being picked on in any meaningful way at all, except that the president has (rightly) noted that the peculiar incentives of wall street, combined with a lack of regulation and, um, morality (my word) led to the collapse of the global financial system, and lots of people had to bail wall street out. kinsley’s friend may not have caused the crisis, but neither did i, and yet republicans in this country seem to be saying that the only people who shouldn’t have to chip in to knock down the deficits that came out of that collapse, two wars that were bought on credit, a medicare benefit that was charged as well, and tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the top tier

had a blast!mccormack’s understanding of barth accounts for the objections that van til and subsequent evangelicals propounded regarding barth’s account of scripture. mccormack answers van til’s allegation that barth “espouses a subjectivism in which human faith is the condition of the bible’s becoming the word of god.” while not resolving all tensions for evangelicals that are committed to a classical account of metaphysics and the historical anglo-american account of enlightenment epistemology, it creates space for dialogue between evangelicals that have divided over barth’s proposals.- strong and lightweight aerospace-grade aluminum frameput aristotle’s and steiner’s logic to work, though, and you have a far more useful tool. take the status quo, and then imagine an opposite that’s just as bad as the status quo, but for the opposite reasons. that makes you think about just what it is about the status quo that’s problematic, to begin with; once you’ve identified the problems, it challenges you to consider the downside of going to the opposite extremes; and once you’ve identified the spectrum of possibilities, it leads you to explore many points along that spectrum, in search of the range of options that offer the most benefits and the fewest drawbacks. it’s far less simple—or simplistic—than going to the opposite extreme; it also works better in the real world, where hard binary oppositions are a good deal less common than muddily complex issues in which moderation is inevitably a better strategy than extremism.it’s been said that we notice faults in others that we are most guilty of because we are more aware of them. i guess this is a form of confession because i find myself in the passive voice many times when i write and then i must go back and rewrite. how much

luxemburgism, that the creation of trades unions is a symbol of the fact that the working class is a revolutionary class, whose conditions of life spontaneously generates a class consciousness, and that it is this class consciousness and the automatically arising collective and solidaristic organisation, which is the basis and form through which the new forms of property under socialism are established. but, a reading of the programme set out here shows that conception is false.450. ham, pineapple stuffing, baked beans, cranberry relish @ home (phoenixville, pa) 8:40 p.m.how time flies -

smacking your head against the sidewalks of ‘irrationality’ and ‘oedipal complexes’. it’s as though you’re sitting next to a good friend, showing you his/her art film. every time you ask a question,

of gaining support through lying and making members of their community believe them through the propaganda they so actively spread. this is starting to sound more and more like a certain violent doctrine i know of. it’s very easy for us to gather our members in each division around the country and attack members of any community. we are part of a grass-roots movement so large and strong, anything is within our capabilities. there is nothing out there that can match our strength. but we chose not to go down this route. the police are not at our demonstrations to protect us. they are there to make sure no harm comes to our counter protesters. but one promise i can make is that if any of our members are attacked like this again, we will act.plus it keeps me from being struck by

someone’s tears,thy wondrous love extending;anyway, smoking:some people are lucky enough to end up in a satisfying and rewarding job that they really enjoy but for others wage labour is a grind; a daily misery that has to be endured. for such people the prospect of self employment has the appeal of making you \"your own boss\" and offering some (albeit limited and largely illusionary) freedom. but going into business, which is what becoming self employed involves, comes at a price. hard decisions will have to be made regarding ones relationships with other members of society and it\\'s not easy to be an entrepreneur and a nice guy. another alternative is to get enough money together to buy your way into the landlord class, and the same tough decisions will have to be made. of course not all business types and landlords are complete scum. indeed many do their best to follow their chosen path in life and at the same try to give everyone a fair crack of the whip; there is after all such a thing as a good landlord. clearly not in that category are the greedy, heartless swine who have decided to make a fast buck by evicting tenents in order to re-let the property (at hugely inflated rents) to olympic tourists.and on top of the fear and the hurt, i’m just plain pissed off. like i want very bad things to happen to him. which is horrible of me and the second i start thinking that

get and keep a freaking j.o.b. he could make that happen for himself. no. i want him to suffer. i want him to feel heartbreak. i want him to be lifted to the top of the world and then thrown into the ground. i want karma to come kick his scrawny little ass for everything he ever put me through, up to and including this latest fiasco. a lot of me has faith that this will happen because that’s just the way things go with me. a very dear friend of mine says it’s because i have a really strong energy force. i don’t know about that, but i do know that people who hurt me get hurt. bad. and 9 times out of 10 they end up regretting doing me wrong. and you know what? i forgive them. i do. not because they got theirs and we’re even, but because over time i recognize they are human and make

kid’s council in the morning. after this, scripts were written for each school for morning announcements to spread the word within all of the schools. we also designed posters for each school to put up in the main entrance of their school. the announcements to remind students to “turn of lights behind you” are made every morning during the week. along with this, each elementary student got a tolby light switch decal and kid-centered action guide. woofta! with all this great work we were able to bring students attention to the simple energy saving action of: turn off lights behind you.perhaps it is all just a coincidence... obviously some artists are unaware of the alternative meanings of the images that they wear on their clothes, as explained before it is a fashionable visual

utterly compelling and it is the type of book that is hard to put down. the reality of the sweatshop is so grim and so horrible that it is hard to fathom how any of it could possibly be true.... and yet, the author herself came from such a background, earning a bachelor\\'s degree from harvard and an mfa in fiction at columbia. although the book is clearly semi-autobiographical, i almost wish the author had written it as a memoir so i had a better sense of where the line between fiction and reality lies in this work. but sometimes truth is even a stranger tale than fiction.i let the cookies

legendary, truly something marvelous and/or frightening to behold, as fervent devotion to favored idols, seiyuu, anime/manga characters, bands and other celebrities goes far beyond mere “fanaticism,” which is perhaps the closest western analogue, although not nearly the same level of intensity. when scandal breaks, the otaku community erupts and the colossal outpouring of visceral response -be it bitterness; resentment; jealousy; or other form of discontent- can spread like a metastasizing, virulent contagion and the effects can linger long after things have technically “blown over.” they can be militantly hostile in defending an icon/franchise and are very outspoken if they feel industry professionals are not living up to perceived standards (just ask anno hideaki).the glories of my god

an incredibly dim magnitude 17 object visible only to professional astronomers and amateurs with extremely large telescopes – and neither the professionals nor the amateurs were much interested in it. such faint comets are fairly common, and this one had been seen on repeated visits since 1892. but in just a few nights it was easily seen with the naked eye. amateur star gazers were dazzled. it was a bright, round cloud in the same general area of the sky as hartley 2 will travel through this fall. yet it was farther away – out beyond the orbit of mars and oriented so that from earth we were looking right down the barrel, so to speak. that is, it had a tail, but the tail of a comet always points away from the sun and in this case it was pointing directly away from us.as you may recall,

for the information broken out by race, it\\'s worth noting that non-hispanic white folks made up 34% of marijuana cases over this period compared to 48.7% of the population citywide in austin, according to the 2010 census. meanwhile, black folks make up just 8.1% of austin\\'s population, but a whopping 28.1% of petty marijuana cases. latinos are the only one of the three largest ethnic categories who are arrested and cited for marijuana at roughly their proportion in the general population. whether the disparity is driven by race or whether race is a proxy for other factors - like police deployment decisions - i cannot say. but i don\\'t understand why the number of marijuana cases should be rising, and i certainly don\\'t understand why black folks would be targeted so much more frequently for enforcement. don\\'t kid yourself. there are a lot of white pot smokers in this town.6. the person who smokes pall mall rears birdsthe magic of the photographs within photographs

the story of a country that is fading away. when charlotte and wilhelm return from mexico to berlin in 1952 to take up their responsibility of building up the new country, the dream of a uniquely german socialist state is still a heady one, an intoxicating vision of an ideal future. as the years progress though, we see the reality of east-german communism, the plastic cars, the crumbling buildings, the power shortages... while stalwarts like wilhelm continue to believe in the system, others feel that the country has lost its way, some (like alexander) hoping to leave it behind for

cross with wild relatives or cultivated varieties. this is because there are no recent reviews in the scientific literature concerning species related to brinjal, and where they grow across asia. this information is vital when addressing concerns regarding cultivation of ge bt brinjal, because insect-resistance gives a selective advantage to the plant, increasing its ability to survive and reproduce. if the ge bt brinjal cross-pollinates wild, weedy or cultivated relatives, the result is a hybrid offspring, which may grow more aggressively and thus become a problem weed, the report says.side note – i’ve been studying about 5-6 hours a day in addition to burning brain cells at work, and buying the case of red bull was one of the best decisions i’ve ever made. yes, this is in

property condition and seismic due diligence as well as construction monitoring. during his thirty years in the industry, bill has developed risk management policies and procedures for one of the world’s real estate lenders and has participated with governmental agencies to refine policies and requirements. bill first became involved in environmental due diligence in 1988, before the creation of current industry standards. as chief of construction and environmental services for a major real estate lender, he developed independent standards for the completion an evaluation of environmental assessment activities. in the mid-90’s he became a founding member of the environmental bankers association. as committee chair for various committees, he worked to assure an in-depth understanding of environmental issues across the membership. more recently, he has consulted with the small business administration and office of the comptroller of the currency regarding environmental policies, participated in the environmental protection agency’s development of standards governing “all appropriate inquiry” and presented various topics at epa brownfield and other industry forums. during his involvement with the early development of due diligence standards to support early cmbs lending programs, bill worked to refine broad industry standards to produce scopes of work more specific to lending risks, resulting in price reductions of nearly 40%. additional cost reductions were realized by implementation of a “small loan” assessment. bill’s ability to cut the fat away from standardized industry products helped control risks while reducing costs and creating a competitive advantage. in 1989, after california’s loma prieta earthquake, bill became involved in the evaluation of earthquake risks associated with owned properties as well as the loan portfolio of a major real estate lender. since no standardized approach to the evaluation of such portfolios existed at that time, he was forced to become familiar with the principles of earthquake risk assessment in order to develop appropriate corporate policies. as the market expanded, he extended his approach to portfolio analysis to include the evaluation of cmbs loans. it quickly became apparent that the industry and even many of the consultants involved in the analysis earthquake risks had a limited understanding of the variables which can significantly impact the conclusions of such studies. bill adopted and defended criteria appropriate to a portfolio-level evaluation of risks which was eventually validated by astm international standards published in 2007.future grandchild….what did you look like young grandma!!ohwow: \"ohwow was established in 2008 by al moran and aaron bondaroff

have a portable one). i recently bought a grill. i’ve always had one because i love to bbq, nothing taste better than food cooked on the grill. i choose a propane weber grill and kept my small charcoal grill. i did this for two reason 1. i may not always be able to afford propane. i keep two large fuel tanks, and many smaller propane tanks. while these are good for now and will get me through a year + without power. there may come a time when i can no longer afford propane. if that is the case then i have my portable charcoal grill. 2. i’ve stocked up on charcoal. during the great

soundtracking warm, aimless nights with “rainbow in the dark” or “hahaha, jk” and the group’s ironically-ironic careless attitude already feels nostalgic in the way that summer records do after just a few months. now in the winter of 2012, we have the first solo mixtapes from das racists’ core mcs. heems (himanchu) has filled his first outing independent of the group, nehru jackets, with a lot more

letter to the owners explaining why we wanted the house and what it would mean to our family (i hinted at our family challenges early last year when i started the blue velvet chair blog if you want to

our spirit guides and angels.” this helps us tell the difference between our “ego” thoughts and our true messages and beliefs that come from within. pg 143 our intuition is not “an audible voice” but a subtle message. to increase your intuitive powers you will first need to be open to being an intuitive person. the second decision is to expect to be intuitive. “expectation acts as a magnet for intuitive feelings.” 145/146. the third decision is to trust the feelings that you are opening to “because your intuitive feelings may not be supported by appearances or confirmed by others.” pg 146 the fourth decision is “…to act on your intuition when it guides you.” “making these four basic decisions – to be open, to expect, to trust, and to act on intuitive feelings, will create a direct conduit for your fifth chakra to communicate messages to you…” pg 146last week i spent five days in nashville working on my first record with my producer, marshall altman. the first three days we were in pre-production. we recorded scratch tracks for 11 original songs (with the exception of be my vision which is a contemporary version of the hymn with a brand new chorus). the process was detailed, trying and really fun. i had to fight for things i really believed in and learn where to let go. it’s probably a good exercise in life too, right? good therapy.water resources in the middle east are subject to an unprecedented pressure which is threatening the populations of entire regions along with their economic activities. population growth, migration, urbanization, and climate change are all exerting an enormous impact on these resources. in fact, over the last 50 years, the flow rate of numerous rivers in turkey, syria, iraq, lebanon, and jordan has plunged by 50 to 90 percent. and yet at the same time, the sustainable management of trans-border water resources is vital to provide for the requirements of agriculture, the need for clean drinking water, and for socio-economic development in general. it is key to avoiding human tragedy and to fostering the promotion of peace.god waited patiently for the right time for christ to be born to bring about the new and perfect

a married couple, except by their lack of a license. (i would say they lack the lifetime commitment, but so do the married people, too, much of the time.) i say, why can\\'t they have a lifetime commitment without the license while they\\'re at it? why can\\'t they go by their local church, synagogue, or hippie guru and proclaim their lifetime commitment? why in the world is it against the law for them to do this? maybe they don\\'t want the state to bother with them. what about that scenario is so terrible?later that night, emmy lou is getting undressed, knowing deep inside that jonah hex is alive. there is a knock on the door. it\\'s the hotel manager with a message. when emmy opens the door she is confronted by two goons and quentin turnbull (okay, make that three goons, or two goons and a heartless bastard) who is demanding the letter (of which emmy knows nothing of) that jonah had entrusted to her!oyster sauce- 1 tspbut cast not your foul notions upon me!nick griffin mep and the british national party will be campaigning to make st georges day a national holiday straight after this years elections!while the bathtub was being refinished we had to shower at the gym around the corner. on this particular occasion, paul made a comment about a young guy’s arms and how he would like to develop his own to look the same.the sight of your eyesdid you hear about that??? now, i like me some coca-cola, but i don\\'t think i could physically drink that much in the span of a day. and now i am scared to death to drink it. especially after i read this...files torrented will be done thru traders little helper onto utorrent 44.1k/16until then, keep looking up. and, keep knowing that i am eternally grateful to all of you who care about me and my family and this project that god has laid on my heart to share with many.did you notice that part about the day trip? stay tuned for a few printables that will help make day trips a breeze! up next week, i\\'m also going to share our linen/bathroom storage solutions, and i haven\\'t forgotten about the mudroom before, during and after reveal. i\\'m just playing hooky from that stuff today!two examples from foster\\'s new book: \"words alone\".resurrect the passed on? can a song, trumpeted,who is the angel of the lord?well...... my gps must have been picking it\\'s nose---because my fellow couchsurfer had driven me past pepe\\'s, and the gps was not leading me anywhere near where she drove me.he lives, my prophet, priest and king.tomorrow we will celebrate christmas in our house. next week we head to gab\\'m\\'s for christmas in dallas. this year will be a first for us -- our first christmas as parents who have lost a son. honestly i don\\'t want to celebrate christmas without you, but how could i not celebrate jesus, in whose very presence you now eternally celebrate?when i woke, i could hear one of my guides telling me quite loudly to go for a walk. i’ve learned through experience to trust my guides and go with whatever they’re telling me because they’re always right. i splashed some cold water on my face, changed into some clothes and grabbed a quick cup of coffee to take along on my walk. i was staying at marga country park, home of a magnificent estate built around 1870 and just below the estate were the ruins of an old abby. the estate or castle, whichever you prefer to call it, was from the neo-gothic time period surrounded by lush gardens and the beautiful rolling hills of wales. in the distance, nestled high on a hillside, you could see the ruins of a monastery. now being a bit of nature person, i thought to myself what a wonderful place to go for a stroll and maybe, just maybe, a brilliant idea would come to me for my speech.radically differentwhere is milena?walton\\'si also don’t know if i’m a little annoyed that yi gak just plans to use her this way. i guess they’ve softened the blow by not making her fall in love with him for real but he really just plans on marrying her and disappearing back to joseon. that’s so not cool.using a zipper foot, baste the zipper to the fabric using a scant 1/4\" seam. start and stop at both ends of the zipper tape. you will sew the side seems later. (no photo)and so they send those manuscripts to me, hoping that somehow i\\'ll be willing to overlook the fact that their first electronic rights have been burned irrevocably. and because i\\'m a sucker, i\\'ll request the whole book. and without exception, those books aren\\'t in any condition to be turned over to my staff for editing much less out there on display for the whole world. out of those submissions, i have not accepted one.i want to write a little something about what happened to me last week and how mark. helped fix it!this is something i’ve debated on and off with quite a few children’s authors. some take a hard line and resist saying anything that could be construed as boasting. others feel that facebook, say, is there for the sharing of good news however big-headed it makes one look. one author i talked to this week resists social networking altogether, because she’s so careful of her public statements.“mulby, man. this guy is seriously freaking me out.”i used papers from my minds eye ‘tickled pink’ range. all the doilys were stamped with my minds eye ‘stella and rose’ stamps (i sooooo love these stamps, they are just so pretty and stamp perfectly…i lurve them )sunday night, though....achoo!sometimes the way i learned growing up seems surreal to me, when i compare it to how most others spent their childhood. like i lived in a different world, despite my physical proximity to everyone else. sometimes (often), i still feel that way! it\\'s such a radically different way of living than that of the mainstream that it\\'s hard to reconcile the two. and i find myself frequently just really, really not getting why anyone thinks the traditional way of teaching small children is a good thing! learning can be so simple, so flowing, and so much fun, if only parents and educators would relax, sit back, be ready to help if wanted, but mainly just let it happen. children are remarkably good at learning! as the great john holt said:happy friday! blogger wasn\\'t working yesterday, and i was getting super antsy because i couldn\\'t wait to tell you about our newest giveaway! the kind people over at perricone md are offering a $150 shopping spree to one lucky helen hearts reader. since i work so closely with the beauty industry, i\\'m especially excited to partner with a company that delivers some of the best skin care products for women.salzburg is such a pretty, quaint town (could do without the mozart madness) and they definitely do it up right for christmas. it was sarah\\'s favorite city...not hard to see why. we christmas marketed, took a trip up to the fortress, wandered around the beautiful cathedral and ate, drank and window shopped, of course.23that we have made ourselves an altar, being false to the lord, keep us not safe from death this day; and if for the purpose of offering burned offerings on it and meal offerings, or peace-offerings, let the lord himself send punishment for it;and to his home he must get. to see his children and try to forget.avoid cosmetics that dry or irritate your skin(paulo sergio valle, máriozinho rocha, marcos valle)the man shot the bow & arrow and almost hit the boyfriend, somehow the boyfriend & girlfriend did not hear or notice the arrow hit the dock near them, and then the fake dashiexp looking man shot his weapon; but he missed too, and it made a loud noise that caused the boyfriend & girlfriend to realize that someone shot at them and so the fake dashiexp looking man jumped into the water with a life vest on.get ready to become a great detective! use the techniques and principles of a great sleuth, interview and investigate. there are lots of great deals out there that are waiting for you to reap the rewards, don’t get taken in by a scam.it is a simple rule often articulated by mr buffett: be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.but once she starts slapping her babies and making them cry, i want to kick her in the head. i’m sorry, but i do. i’ve watched so many moms haul off and whack a baby’s back so hard you can feel the hollow thud in your teeth. a flag should drop. a penalty box. disqualification. intervention. something. but, like everything else to do with women and babies in crisis, there is nothing. only silence. only people like me, the bastion of balls and bravery, quietly wheeling my cart the other way.ah! but do i hear you cry: \\'hold on, uncle dick! how is that possible?

eh?i decided to go with water colouring....... bit of a stretch for me.........but i was determined to give it a go. so i bought watercolour pencils (they are so lovely i didn\\'t want to use them lol), and a water-colour sketch pad.the fling surpassed my expectations. i was expecting the felt work in my scandinavian rug class to be physically grueling. it was. (i am glad i did some training by making two natural fleece rugs on my own; plus all my gardening!) what i was not expecting was how easy everything else was and just how wonderful it would be to spend a week with people who all spoke felt. i also wasn\\'t expecting to learn so much outside of class, though i should have been. i find fiber artists to be so much more willing to share and support than groups of artists in other mediums. for example, after the show and tell for erma yost\\'s class i spoke with her about using some of my old woodcut blocks for printing on fabric. i have been wanting to try this for a long time, and erma gave me many tips and showed me which paints she like to use. so through the wonderful rug class with rod and karoliina, visiting the other studios, show and tell nights, and conversations with so many other feltmakers i learned so much and i am filled with ideas of things i want to try.a lot of my friends are artists. i admire and envy their facility. art attracts me enormously, but i have no skill. i could blame being badly taught, or left handedness, but i have never been able to draw or paint or take a half way decent photograph.during the 1950s and 1960s powell appeared regularly on television. these credits included guest spots on nearly all the major variety shows of the period such as perry como, the andy williams show, the kraft music hall, frank sinatra, the ed sullivan show, the hollywood palace, the red skelton show, eddie fisher, the dinah shore show, the dean martin show, the smothers brothers, jonathan winters, this is tom jones, the garry moore show, the jerry lewis show and the judy garland show. she did a stint as one of the what’s my line? mystery guests on the popular sunday night cbs-tv programme. she also appeared as guest panelist on the same show. tv specials included “meet me in st. louis”, “young at heart”, “feathertop”, “danny thomas show 1967″, “victor borge show”, “ruggles of red gap” on producers’ showcase and “hooray for love”. dramatic guest spots included both the dick powell show and the june allyson show. she also had a failed tv pilot for a sitcom called “the jane powell show”. powell was also a regular guest on tv variety shows in australia when she visited there to perform her nightclub act. she also had a one-off tv special in that country in 1964.we do also need squares for \\'one heart from around the world\\' but if you would like to make a heart square of your own choice then please do so.he won the contest, so i took these photos and not only printed them for the family, but took them to be laminated and mounted with a stand.‘he could have been 15 but he could have been 23. he could have been a paedophile or a rapist.yep, almond extract.after all of the hype, reloaded failed to deliver on most every level. it confused, angered, and generally wore out everyone in the theater and we all left thinking: “just what are they going to do to end this thing?”as always the kids have a fabulous time at the creek. while i\\'m running around snapping pictures of the wildflowers, they are climbing trees, wading in the water, feeding fish and catching salamanders and crawdads. they are also learning to identify many of the different plants and flowers in the area. my daughter is extremely inquisitive and wants to know the name of everything. my boy acts less interested, but is a total sponge with knowledge. i\\'m sometimes surprised by the amount of information he retains when i don\\' even realize he is listening. he can often tell me the name of wildflowers that i\\'ve forgotten. :)the need to know and the ability to predict what others are thinking to do or will do or how nature behaves is essential part of human scientific spiritual growth from the time we discovered fire. for example we want to know whether rains come or not next year. this helps farmers to decide to either sow or not to sow. the rain pattern helps governments to prepare for draught management. oppositions parties to blame governments. again if rains come we want to know will there be heavy rains so that flood management can be activated. we want to know if there will be medium rains and limited water availability then planning can be done for alternate crop patterns. we also want to know if there will be very little rains so draught crops can be sown and water conservation can be activated. if there are super heavy rains like cyclones we want to know at least 2 days before so that all population can be evacuated to safe areas. the entire meteorology departments were existing for this function of predicting cyclones using again mathematical modeling of temperatures, wind gusts moisture etc.you see ever since we came to the uk just after our marriage, a little less than three years ago, we have been planning to travel. it was one of the juiciest carrots my husband dangled to bring me to the uk. he showed me dreams of seeing europe, not in 15 days but slowly, steadily, a little at a time. needless to say i fell for it, hook, line and sinker. the first year when he was a full time student and me, sporadically employed, travel was an unthinkable luxury. second year we were finding our feet, settling in the hectic life of london fresh from the green pastures and slow life of oxford. but by third year we were ready to travel. boy, we were raring to go. some things we decided on--more than what christopher lao did, there are other things that made me think about, like:it makes me happy to share all of my diy projects and ideas with my readers. i\\'ve been getting back such great responses. i have many more projects to share and i can\\'t wait to start room reveals! until my next post...gehry asked decker, \"how would you do it, ideally?\"in my last entry, i described my long-held dream to go to africa. this dream of mine is probably as synonymous with my identity as my u2 obsession and ridionculoso memory for random trivia. so when i cancelled my january 2012 plans to go out to kenya last autumn – there was understandable confusion in the eyes of everyone around me.a. a whipso what are the arcane masters of the revenue proposing to do to recoup this massive amount we\\'re notionally all depriving the treasury of?

because frankly, it’s none of their damn business.now that said, people certainly could be better at in person conversations. i love people who can pretty much talk about anything. they are either well read, good actors, or know how to ask questions. or all of the above. conversation is a skill and if i was a teacher, i’d have it as part of my curriculum. how much further in life could we all get if we had excellent interpersonal communication skills?

connection is 2 corinthians 5:17, \"therefore if any man be in christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new.\" last week we talked about how our music should change once we\\'ve accepted christ as saviour. this verse tells us that the changes should not stop with just our music. old things are to pass away and all things are become new. this means those old attitudes, actions, vocabulary and ways of thinking need to change. depending on the person, it may require a change of wardrobe, viewing habits and how we interact with others. why do we need to change? because we are a new creature in christ. we are not the same as we used to be and we now wear the name of christ. people should be able to see a difference in our lives; we should not

gonna wait?”well, it looks like it\\'s gonna be a beautiful day in the neighborhood round here.having said that, i won’t rule out that sitting stationary at our family dining table in the front room and staring at my laptop for many hours of the day has something to do with feeling sluggish and tired. admittedly it has often been the lack of any vibrant movement that has got me a bit irritated at times. but alas, when one needs their laptop for almost everything (as most people do nowadays): sending emails; monitoring projects; reading articles & journal entries; typing up documents etc…not to mention the fact that i haven’t seen or socialised with any of my friends for 8 days now (which is actually a long time when you usually live with your best friends), it’s pretty much a given that one would feel a tendency to get frustrated. however, this holiday, and other recent ones like it, i’ve been taking conscious steps to still remain a normal functioning human being, and not a robot from being cooped up in exile; studying, reading and writing.the first morning i came to the stable to feed the horses, she did not wake up to eat, she just stayed sleeping. now, that is normally a bad

some really good ideas yesterday on that front--more on that soon. and i heard back from match prof, who, on friday, had suggested lunch this week. :-) we\\'ve agreed on thursday. we have a time and

so feeling the rest of me looks good should help my self-confidence.... fortunately, my elbow is gradually healing, my voice has been sounding almost normal, and the spot on my nose is fading. i just

category!i’ve been hesitant to blog about this until i knew for sure that it was really going to happen. well, due to matters that i will not disclose on this blog, sifu is taking an extended hiatus from kung fu and chin na. this has been developing since about january and the quality of the instruction has definitely suffered. there is some talk of senior students trying to carry on. in fact, that’s been going on for several months and it’s really not the same. i stuck it out as long as could; however, as of may 1, 2010 i decided to resign from my kung fu school.getthis drama is hilarious. i really had a great time watching it raw and never did it waver when i finally watched it with subs. lee seung gi is such a.. what’s the right term? vainglorious? he’s played an arrogant-jerk in shining inheritance as a chaebol. then as an irresponsible, action-star-wannabe in mgiag. now, i feel like its a combination of all the characters he’s played and it fits him to a t. the teasers for this show kinda threw me off.. because i never thought of seeing seung gi to be so serious. i mean, military? then again, drama surprised me since they didn’t really strip off seung gi of what i’ve known him to be and what i’ve grown to love about him.‘like crazy’ is a quiet movie. what you hear is low-key dialogue, as opposed to loud explosions and cars crashing. unfortunately, the quiet tone of the film was interrupted by the loud eating of the couple to my left. these people were eating their pop corn with remarkable vengeance. it was as if the pop corn had inflicted major pain upon them and it was revenge-time. they were attacking the paper bag like it was the last available food on earth. and do you know what happens when you attack a paper bag? it makes a loud noise. and do you know what happens when you are munching pop corn? yes, that’s right, you are very loud and the person to your right is wishing you would choke on it.lip service: and it\\'s back. like sherlock, bbc3 decided that waiting nearly a year and a half for the second series of the scottish drama was a great idea. on the plus side, this was a solid opening episode. i\\'m not keen on the frankie/cat/sam

wonder if i will write the girl continually, like hag-duras in the lover, and conjure her up, and conjure me up, will i ever feel at rest or at peace. or perhaps: i will always be a girl, which is to be always in flux, the reclaiming of d&g\\'s becoming-woman that uses all masculine archetypes. this was the subject, partially, of the facebook discourse earlier today. anyway: on: feminism and sex. on messy feminisms. on girlhood, which is being messy, and desire, which is always messy. the first piece for n+1 (if i can manage) due labor day - memoir+criticism+reportage? - on: lena dunham\\'s girls, and maybe francesca woodman, and maybe m.c., and maybe a subject of boundaries. but i think lately watching girls using a good pal\\'s hbo go subscription, that i\\'m interested/obsessed with ideas of authenticity and this experience, and is that the search, authenticity. versus what - a melodrama? isn\\'t being a girl melodramatic? or: the other side of fakery: commodification. am i making sense here? also, as kate durbin said today on facebook, horror is the perfect genre to consider the girl. yes:and perhaps my issue with girls: the tv show: it is sitcom when it also reads so queasy horror. i don\\'t know. the second essay of this for frequencies, due early fall? on acker and the archive at duke, but really: about how acker subverts and complicates the idea of the kunstlerroman, which maybe also segues with lena dunham\\'s girls, and maybe i cannot for the life of me write anything discreetly or discretely. i don\\'t know. also: writing of lispector, maybe.

about them, and have shown her the orion constellation and looked things up for her. but she gets most of her space information from her boopa, who is so interested in space that he has multiple star projectors (he even gave her a small one last year to keep) and telescopes and knows more about things in space than slipshod and i do. sweet pea loves - no, loves - to see pictures of celestial bodies. she already knows more about space than i do. she tells me about galaxies and nebulas and all kinds of cool stuff. she has added \"space scientist\" to her list of things she wants to be when

skip exercising and go eat donuts instead.i read somewhere an argument that speaks to me on this: film studios have no real problem with ‘test screening’ a movie for audiences across the nation. the director of the movie doesn’t just drop some film reels off on some producer’s desk and walk away. there’s constant tweaking, even after it’s been called “done”. what are “director’s cut” editions, if not either the movie as the director originally envisioned it or tweaks to the film after it was shown to audiences? book authors are a different matter, but they still have editors looking out to make sure the book is as cohesive as they can make it. heck, even published works can get a brand-spanking new epilogue after the book’s been out for a while. so why is it that this video game, which has much more flexibility in terms of last-minute tweaks, is suddenly supposed to be set in stone? nobody calls the test audience for movies “whiny entitled brats” if they didn’t like the ending. it means somebody misjudged the audience, and if it’s a serious enough misjudgement (is that even a word?) then the studios fix it. so even these other “works of art” are fixable right up to and beyond the point of publication/screening/distribution.i\\'m sure we could spend all kinds of time trying to equate different family members between the two, but suffice to say that both families are

not be more thankful for that. i had one other student with me full time during the rotation and that only served to make the experience even better. it was so nice to have a partner in crime for the

the cutting edge and the inner embossing edge. if you\\'ve not tried this before, it\\'s a nice easy technique - easier with a lightbox (but i didn\\'t have time to dig mine out so it is possible without one). secure the die inside with the cutting edge facing the outside of the card, turn it over and rub gently with a bone folder - this creates a soft line on top of the cutting edge so you know where to put your ball tool to begin. the trick is to go over the lines a couple of times to get the depth (i use a double ended tool and start with a thicker end then use a narrow one for definition once the fibres have stretched) - if you go too hard and deep too fast, you just rip the card stock. you can do the same thing on an embossing machine but i think you get a deeper impression by hand.thank you for your visit and for your sweet comments!!i always thought it\\'s a normal thing, happen to many women because i\\'ve heard many mention it?many of my favourite actors to work with have been my fellow theatre cast mates from theatre productions i’ve done over the years. but in film and tv, i have been fortunate, too, and some of my favs are hilary swank – she’s incredibly focused. our scenes were so intense. i learned so much from working with her on ‘the reaping’. i loved working with minnie driver and eddie izzard on the fx tv series ’the riches’. they are both such lovely spirited people, and were so devoted to that project. but my favourite star so far would have to be brooke shields, with whom i just finished working on ‘the hot flashes’. she is so

then told me that really she had only asked if we were available for four of those children, as they had found someone who would take the oldest and youngest already. they were hispanic, and were currently split up in three different homes. wow. that was a lot to take in. we spent an hour in prayer and talking about it before calling our worker back. the interesting thing was that my hubby’s devotions that day just happened to be the story of moses, and how he was rescued from certain doom by someone not his mother; what amazing things did god do with him?!? what if god wanted to use us just as he used pharaoh’s daughter, to step in and parent some children that he wanted to do great things with? we called our worker and asked her if we could just come by her office and meet with her.*you can stop it & peek in the door at 90 seconds to check if its done - it will probably rise over the top of the mug as it\\'s heating, & if it\\'s still runny it\\'s not done yet. but be

if s&s does exploit the rights at some future point, it will be doing so under old contracts. as the development of the ebook market has made clear, new technologies demand new terms and new

say’ “see you later” and not “good bye” before he started his new journey. so, maxxie mcelderry, here’s to you. thank you for the love. thank you for the moments you barked at me, and for that first day i met you and you ran to me and lay your head on my heart chakra. i never felt so much love before you did that.after this entire experience, i feel like i have finally taken the running leap off the cliff. i feel like i have finally hurled myself as far away as my speed and energy will allow me and my landing will be a bit of a splash but surfacing is now something i can do my way and on my time.1 tablespoon unsalted butterschrödinger wasn\\'t saying that we have to believe that a cat can be dead and alive at the same time. he was saying that our current understanding of quantum physics suggests that the cat is dead and alive, which doesn\\'t make sense, and either that therefore we haven\\'t yet explained it properly, or that quantum science doesn\\'t follow the rules of the rest of the universe. (which we know is true - but we want to know what rules it follows.)treat your self, and don’t wait for someone else to do it, if they do great! that’s a start to loving a very special someone, who deserves lots of wonderful things. you thought it would be a tablespoon of this, and a cup of that? really!!800-888-1447, 300 park avenue, warminster, pa 18974c: exactly. if it had said “stuff racist people do” or “stuff racist people say”, okay, i could understand that. but stuff white people do? that’s racist towards white people, and not just society as a whole. because everyone is racist on some level, why should whites be targeted any more than asians or africans? being of a certain ethnic background doesn’t make you racist. it’s a human condition. the blog link doesn’t reflect that, so no, i’m not going to check it out.the first crack appears in the granting of residency, which the holder can get after one year. however, the residency is only for as long as the visa lasts and six months prior they must again get the visa and extend the residency. only after five years can they then apply for citizenship.stamps: solo flight (monica) hmjr 11053. a device used for straightening out dead people and keeping them that way while you wired them into place.they are children. they just want to play. and they’ll play, learn and develop along the lines of whatever we give them.rom 1:25 who changed the truth of god into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator, who is blessed for ever. amen.i took a picture of the beer poured in a pint glass, but my friend erased it before i could upload it. anyway, it was very dark, almost black, with a creamy, light brown head. this beer was tasty. i could taste the sort of granite taste it\\'s supposed to have. this beer was just as smooth as all the others from samuel smith.for a second opinion, i sent it to a close friend (who knows me all to well) to read, and give feedback. she loved it (fear obliterated) but thought there might be some questionable parts (fear confirmed)…for a moment i thought maybe it was a bad idea, putting myself out there exactly how i am, i was getting ready for a rewrite…when a text arrived from my friend. she said that she had reread it and thought that i shouldn’t change anything! there wasn’t anything questionable, she reevaluated, and she thought it was fabulous! (*sigh*) yes she’s that important to me. her opinion means a great deal to me as a person and an artist.i have spent the rest of the night trying to figure out what it is that i need. she asked me what my life would look like if it did not completely revolve around s. because right now it does. the job i have, the house i live in, the school district, the dog, how i spend all of my time-- that all revolves around him. i take breaks from him, and do other things--- but i always justify it in my head by saying, \"i am doing this so that i can take better care of him when i am done.\"it has now came to light that the sa police have \"lost\" 20 429 weapons since april 2004.build smaller prisons. ... large prisons become \"violentocracies\" -- places ruled by violence and by the threat of violence. in a violentocracy, the most violent people rise to the top. in any prison of any size, the prisoners are going to be pushed toward the level of the most violent persons in the facility. ... in a prison 3,000 people, the entire prison is pushed toward the level of violence created by the five most violent people in the joint. the most violent person finds the second-most violent person and the third-most violent person, and they form an alliance to exploit the weak. everyone else is compelled to avoid looking weak. ... large prisons promote paranoia in the prisoners. you never know who in here is waiting for you with a homemade knife. ... a prison of 20 people is, by its very nature, extremely different. you know who is in there with you; you know who you have to stay away from. ... plus, if you have many small prisons, you can contain the violent people in a limited number of those prisons, the preventing their violent tendencies from infecting the rest of the prison population. ... what you would do, with a network of small prisons, would be to place each prisoner in a facility that is appropriate to the threat that he represents. you grade the prisoners on the threat of violence that they represent, one through ten. you put the tens with the tens and the ones with the ones. plus, when you move to a system in which some prisoners have more rights and live in more humane conditions, you create a powerful incentive to get into one of the less restrictive prisons.. in a large and horrible prison, the new prisoner thinks \"i\\'ve got to show everybody here how tough and vicious i really am, so that nobody will mess with me.\" but when you put a new prisoner in a 24-man prison with 23 other tought guys, and he knows that there are other prisons that are not like this, his natural thought is \"i\\'ve got to get out of here. i\\'ve got to show these people that i am not a crazy, vicious sociopath, so they will move me to some other facility that is not populated by crazy, vicious sociopaths.\"i love smoothies, i drink them all the time. over the past few months i’ve been trying to not use so much yogurt and got it down to a tablespoon. which, is

see a propaganda system at work where the media are private and formal censorship is absent. this is especially true where the media actively compete, periodically attack and expose corporate and governmental malfeasance, and aggressively portray themselves as spokesmen for free speech and the general community interest. what is not evident (and remains undiscussed in the media) is the limited nature of such critiques, as well as the huge inequality in command of resources, and its effect both on access to a private media system and on its behavior and performance.adult saturday full-£50

affect. the grinding in between. the antagonism we reference above is resultant of one being thrown amongst the detritus of society. those forgotten. that’s how it begins. a violence that confronts the somnambulist as they are awakened from their complacent, passive, acceptance of the world about. the attempt to striate the miasma, to diffuse the smell, to relegate and delineate roles and responsibility, has created a zone of possibility where finally . . . finally, the representative becomes expressive. this i believe was the goal and intent of a ms. zoe strauss. an utterance that

supposedly the dragon stands as a symbol for the great unity of the chinese nation. it says some chinese considered themselves as descendants of a dragon. the dragon was the symbol of the emperor, yet people used to worship the dragon because they believed it would bring the timely winds and rains for their crops. the dragon was seen as a symbol of harmony. not a great deal of information, but certainly the little bit there was i found to be quite interesting. i like it when chart books come with little bits of information like this one did. the pattern book ancient egyptian cross stitch by

beckett and richard brautigan. by ‘complete’ i mean of course those that are still generally available. and i would also have to exclude works of non-fiction. those scraps aside i’ve read everything

emphasising the universal nature of it, religions comfort us with the knowledge that we are not alone. true happiness is impossible in this lifetime, we can only hope for a nicer afterlife. the trouble with this theory, is how readily it lends itself to keeping people in misery whilst telling them that it’s good for them. compassionate sharing is one thing, oppression another and there are times when it’s not easy to see what you’ve got.remember it is best that the children do this one at a time to lower the injury risk, we used a wooden spoon to smack ours :-) here is a good video link

hole. he placed the box inside a steel box in the ground. then they asked if we had anything else to place in the box with her. we didn’t know we could do that. no one told us and i didn’t think to ask. i had never done this before. but nephew’s mom had the bouquet which she was pleased to put in the box. i put in a red rose as did my sister-in-law. that was it. we didn’t know what else to do.i want my thoughts to disappear but they won’t, and i won’t do anything to make them vanish. i remember when he said that “we both went into this relationship knowing it wouldn’t last forever.” that was at the beginning of it. in the middle, we did want it to last forever, but honestly, it never was going to last forever, and i never knew that i would have shared everything with him. i sincerely wish it could have been forever. i really wish it could have been longer, at least make happier memories. it’s really sad. i’m not ready to give back these things. i feel so, so light yet heavy. the necklace is off, and has been off and i miss it… i want it back on, but i won’t put it on.we have a lot of basil in our garden, somehow this year i\\'ve managed to grow more of it than i normally use (there seems to be forever a jar of pesto in the fridge!), which just means that i\\'ve become a bit more creative in how i use it, or (most of the time) just throw it into dishes more often. it added an extra dimension to a stir fry of thinly sliced kangaroo (marinated briefly in soy, sambal oelek and garlic), mushrooms, a red pepper from the garden and jasmine rice - its stronger aniseed notes went really well with the asian flavours in the wok. it was such a simple delicious dinner, i\\'m no longer bound by italian cooking when thinking of how to use my basil! i have purple basil as well, but tend to use the green basil more often purely because i have more of it, it\\'s thrived where the purple basil has been much more subdued (though its a very pretty addition to any garden!).it

can’t stand still-dirty laundry800m swimwhare hunters fand the murder\\'d bairn (child);teachers have a different ‘knowledge’ than parental knowledge and it comes into play because unlike any other profession, teachers are given the privilege of working with children and often times the parents don’t even know us by name. teachers have to earn that trust day in and day out – with parents, but more importantly with students. the trust is so explicit that we are often told more than anyone else by students about their life and only when we have proof or a darn strong feeling that the ‘hypothetical’ discussion taking place is real can we report the issue to parents or social services. we can ask all manner of questions, suggest other people the student can talk to, services and phone numbers to contact but we are limited in giving opinions. by law we are mandated reporters and we stress to children that what they tell us falls into this category because we want them to know we care enough to do what is right, no matter what the outcome. sometimes the most we can do is recommended to the school psychologist, the administrator, etc. that this child have an appointment. we can not even write our concerns in the cumulative file so we share them with another teacher(s) because each child is so precious to us and we don’t want something to happen.at the vatican, borgia’s called aside by della rovere, who tells borgia that, if he were a different man, della rovere would vote for him. borgia’s been a good vice chancellor, and the skills that made him good at that would

any battles he fights, but after all, this is in god’s hands.in this oceanfloor of mercyas this was of course, a rather special card, i decided to make it a coordinating box, so used the same pearlescent cardstock as the card base & part of the cross for the box\\'s top & decorated it with another spellbinders\\' cross as well as a lacy shape from the lace doily accents set. the four tiny sections which had popped out of the die cut silver cross i used as embellishments & added them to the corners of the box lid. i then created an insert for the box (well, it isn\\'t as if i didn\\'t

of ots, just to earn a few more bucks. by the time you get home, you’ll be too tired to have a proper bonding session with your children. having kids and seeing them only a few hours each day and two

music is better than miserable stuff (of which i have a lot). the important thing is to be comfortable with my audio environment.natural sources of vitamin d include:size: 5x7 inchesdid you have a

experience, that the daemon always knows the detail and construction of a piece it has decided you will work on, but it cannot tell you directly. or chooses not to tell. you are guided by images and feelings, steered along the path it wants you to follow by nudges and hints. when we are \\'stuck\\' in a story, we have simply wandered from the path. if we stop trying to find it, if we try not to think consciously, but wait and let our thoughts drift – then the daemon will guide us back to the path with more hints and nudges. when we struggle to find the way ourselves, we fall into mires and thorns, we get further and further from where we want to be, and the story \\'goes dead under our hand\\'.9. you identify aspects of your professional life, where you could be stern enough to

deity of christ today, stephen j. nichols bounces off the work of stephen prothero and argues that we have gone from a creedal jesus, to a human jesus that is close and ended up with a jesus that has liberated itself from christianity and the bible (p. 27). stephen points out that there have been many attempts within our american culture to present jesus. movies like the passion of christ, consumerism and our nifty slogans and even politics where jesus is somehow on everyone’s side, show us that our cultural attempts to display jesus have left us with “personal jesuses who look far more like their makers than like the jesus of sacred scripture and the historical creeds (p.31).”daryl awoke at our property in wy this morning.it should be easy hey...but nope...it wasn\\'t...mary: what

“starving artist” period, some time in the last century, i found myself doing just about anything to make a buck. shortly before working as a sorority house security guard, but right after the funeral

years of political campaign work, but they didn’t care–they were just looking for warm bodies.slideshow of samples:dr. jawad then said he was off to the us embassy islamabad for a private screening of

when our table was ready, he took out my seat and ordered a fantastic bottle of wine to go with dinner. the conversation was relaxed and easy, and then i made a joke. the laugh that came from the person sitting in front of me made me want to run for the high hills! i was not only loud, but had this quality of being high pitched, nasal\\'y and throat\\'y all at the same time. i was literally

of pie in the sky. virtually everyone in irish society, including myself, would love to see a scandinavian model of child care being in place by the end of this year. i differ from some of those who claim it would not be possible, in that i believe it would be possible were there a real will and determination to make it happen. however, significant resources would be required. this defies credibility, given the fact that this idea is coming from a government that is slashing, burning and cutting left, right and centre and is committed to considerable further budget cuts in the next two years under the eu-imf austerity programme. if we pass the fiscal treaty, we will be required to make even more severe budget cuts in subsequent years. from where will the government get the money and resources to put in place a scandinavian child care model? the minister and i would like to see such a model. ireland did not put it in place when the celtic tiger was in full swing, yet the minister is telling the house that she will have it in place within six months at a time when austerity butchery is cutting everything. the minister does not honestly believe it will be done.all views can be kept anonymousin the hard single bed, kathleen’s feet sweat as she heard claire stomping down the stairs to deliver her some indian dish that she picked up every wednesday from a trendy grocery store on her way home from work. it was too spicy for kathleen’s palate and the meat was the same indistinguishable goop as the vegetables, but she ate it every week and pretended to be appreciative. she took a few bites to appease claire, who was tittering about what she had for lunch that day at work. claire looked all around the room, focusing her eyes on the bed skirt, the crooked throw rug, the smashed bug high in the left corner that no one had the heart to wipe away. kathleen could tell that claire had things that she wanted to say but couldn’t bring herself to. every few days she’d bring

him about his role. sadly, he wasn\\'t keen on conversation, which on reflection is probably an occupational hazard, what with the headset. for all i know he could have been in on a conference call with a host of delegates from fifa\\'s head office in zurich. this is unlikely though. i would expect an organisation as spendthrift as fifa to be more generous with the quality of employee trousers. by all accounts sepp blatter is a tolerant man, but badly pressed black trousers would not reflect well on fifa. no, a far more plausible explanation was that his headset was plugged into a cassette player. the assessor would spend his evening listening to the recording in order to write his report on the referee\\'s performance. let it be said, the role of referee\\'s assessor isn\\'t all

miraculously reduces preterm births (i haven\\'t read the study yet, but i wouldn\\'t put it past you to indulge in such superstition), the findings for smokers strongly suggest that this is nonsense as well. or perhaps you are going to claim that smokers somehow feel the benefit of secondhand smoke reductions as well. nothing would surprise me at this stage.having earlier said that i can understand not going too deep into the backstory, a critical element of the books is classism, leaving it out of the movie altogether, or only *barely* mentioning it, does the series an extreme

(okay, maybe not the entire theme, but a main one) when you \"get\" that children are putting their names into the drawing for tributes more than once in order to possibly win food/wealth for their families, it brings that class/poverty/social-strati thing right to the forefront. the kids from well-off families aren\\'t in there but once. yes, it\\'s mentioned in passing, but it\\'s not explained.what we can\\'t do, though, is pretend that the vpo is an orchestra just like any other. it\\'s not. it\\'s the living embodiment of an exclusionary philosophy that should, at the very least, give any thoughtful person pause.editor’s notes:the bush bailoutwhat better way to spend a cold afternoon, than letting your progeny throw a very heavy ball at some tiny pins that seem to be permanently glued down? okay, i can think of a few other things, but they would all involve palm trees and margaritas, besides, the kids are really excited. truth be told, i recently attended a grown up bowling party for a friend\\'s birthday and despite my dismal score, i had a really good time.i can\\'t eat,interested in what i used on this card? here is a recipe...why not? a couple of years ago while i was sitting in the departure wing of the montreal airport, a security officer was weaving his way through the crowd at “schritttempo” or translated from german, walking speed.have been randomly picked. congratulations to all our winners and thank you to all those who helped us celebrate. we are looking forward to a another two years!!!he once butchered a deer in my basement because he didn\\'t want his wife knowing he\\'d bagged it. when i went outside, i realized he had dragged the bleeding carcass from the bed of his pickup truck to my cellar door...over the fresh, white snow. my yard looked like the scene of a massacre.the critics are pounding peta for a perceived cavalier attitude towards the physical abuse of women, and the proponents want everyone to just freakin’ lighten up.i filled in at my previous job today. it was gratifying to see how may residents wanted me back full time. i felt like mother theresa for oh, 10 seconds or so. i do love my peeps.i — mitt romney was right when he said the us auto industry should go bankrupt, because:what is concerning parents and children even more is that on friday, parents found out that asbestos removal will start tonight. they are rightfully angry that they have not received enough warning.but there was one thing i found interesting.and now, the extremely funny news. even those of us who do become indistinguishable from native speakers, including where native speakers themselves can’t tell the difference, fail to reach native proficiency: we have near-native-like proficiency instead (i’m not joking, seriously!). this is because we human beings, for all our native competence, are apparently fallible in our judgements about our languages. we don’t notice what we don’t care about, whereas the machines that we build to make our judgements for us do: the proof is in reported examples of millisecond differences in, for example, the amount of puffed air that emanates from native and non-native vocal tracts pronouncing the sounds at the beginning of english words like pan, tan and can (this is the “aspiration of voiceless plosives”, in the insider lingo).king harvest- dancing in the moonlightwhen it came to the moynihan station project, which could involve a new rail station in the farley post office, the relocation of madison square garden, and new office towers and retail over the current penn station/msg site, brodsky had the same basic questions. “how do i know how the public investment should be made versus private--what’s the rule?” he asked.so what is left of the pool today? it still stands in the same spot, but the exterior has changed completely. redevelopment in the 1980s gave it a second skin of concrete cladding and additional office space, but the interior was largely untouched. naturally though i was not able to go inside and take photos!with short stories like this it is difficult because, as i know myself, stories that have got nowhere in one comp, have won another, with no further edits, so i don’t lose heart is what i’m saying! we had a team of 5 reading the many entries, all with guidelines and enough experience to really know what was good and what didn’t work as well and remember it is also relative to what else we have in.70nor wish\\'d an angel whom i lov\\'d a man.the 33-minute video starts with thomas being approached by fullerton police department officer manuel ramos, who engages him in conversation. by minute 15, ramos has already donned latex gloves. \"you see my fists?\" ramos asks thomas. \"they\\'re getting ready to fuck you up.\"gore vidal likes to explore round all the nooks and crannies of my dirty little cave. party time, who had to take to the streets and sleep on the footpath this last few months has thusly chosen to sleep on the floor instead of in my bed or on the sofa, which is where he used to kip when he lived with me before. so party time stays down on the floor most of the time and playing with gore vidal i enjoy seeing his, albeit flaky, composure return.these technical directors were posed the question if more technical information should be released to the fans?clapping and requesting christmas songs from the carolers.to see what the other challenge team members have come p with make sure you\\'ll check out6. what is a cause near and dear to your heart?she mentioned something about clothes dividers for the baby\\'s clothing. i was at joann\\'s and ran across these cute tiny little hangers in the unfinished wood section of the store. they were a dollar a piece and since i will buy practically anything if it is \"only a dollar\". i picked them up.-ph balanced to be gentle and non-irritating to skin and eyesa grotty, grizzly day greets me as i draw back the curtains. i groan inwardly, grabbing my gear to get ready for my run. my tired old legs try to pretend they don\\'t understand the instructions i am giving but by the time i reach the granville road corner they are resigned to another gruelling task. on and on they trudge, with gritty determination, only coming to grinding halt when they have finally completed the circuit. great going legs!a fruitful harvestthere does come a time when most kids who loved hugs as a young child, no longer want to be hugged. be attuned to this and don’t insist. the reasons are many and complex, mainly having to do with growing awareness of sexual feelings.if the power requirements are comparable, we will still need fossil fuels to accomplish large-scale effects, just as we would through the use of technology. this implies that using magic to combat pollution might simply beget more pollution.i am still walking around pretty much dumbfounded. we all are. graham said, \"didn\\'t you ask for the answer to be written in the sky?\" i had completely forgotten that i\\'d even said that four hours before.i can understand why israelis who have had to endure terrorist attacks from their arab neighbours for decades and who have lost significant numbers of their compatriots in this terror were eager to point out that the norwegian left have gone a very long way in condoning the behaviour of militant palestinian terrorist organizations. in an interview with the israeli newspaper maariv, on july 25, 2011, the norwegian ambassador to israel, svein sevje attempted to draw distinctions between the terrorist attack in norway and the numerous terrorist attacks that have plagued israel. in the interview mr sevje says that it is easier to understand that militant palestinians resort to terror because of israel’s ‘occupation’ of palestinian land. mr sevje also claimed that peace can only be achieved if the israelis engage in direct talks with the terrorist organization hamas:- apple unveiled this weird itunes music store idea (it\\'ll never work..);here are some of the pics that i wanted to share of her end-of-the-year homeschool choir concert. i only wish i could download the video shorts of some of the concert, so you could be blessed by their singing. those will go up on my facebook page for the rest of my family to see.happy friday! hope you\\'ve had a great week. i had a sinus infection and strep throat, and i\\'m just now getting back to all the things i\\'ve let slide over the past few days. let\\'s just say i\\'ll be spending a lot of time in the laundry room.2:00pm – 3:00pmbut first, let me take you back to the summer of \\'91 when i was an lca on the 727 panel at pan am. things were not going well. we were selling routes. the big cherry just picked was the european operation (frankfurt hub/a-310s) and the ny shuttle (lga hub/727s) going to delta. delta wanted the crews they were prepared to take already trained in seat and type. so to accomodate the senior folk alpa, the feia and management rebid the airline. those who would have been saved from the inevitable collapse (like me) by going to delta were now looking down both barrels at unemployment, furlough notice in hand and 90 days to figure out what to do. yeah, my union was looking out for me again god bless \\'em. so when i get called into the office and told in effect \"you will be training your replacements\" (the 747 f/es who were bidding back to the 727 panel) i was at a loss for words. a thousand emotions flew across my mind.be extra careful not to push on the clear plastic piece on the small end of the viewfinder, as it may push inward. if you do happen to push in the little plastic window, you need to try to glue it back in place through the screw holes in the viewfinder, which sounds extremely difficult and frustrating. the front chrome piece does come off, but you stand a very good chance of breaking it trying to do so.i am greatly afflicted.as it turned out, i would be leaving with a bit of both.pink fairies: between the linesbowie – golden years – statio to station (1976)colin is fairly amusing compared to natalie portman.“3 – there is no need for faith, because a substitute is a substitute for all our sins. yet the scriptures say we need faith to be justified.”while the quiche was in the oven i prepared a lovely carrot salad, adapted from a recipe by (my favorite) mark bittman. this is also a dish that can be made ahead. if you do make it ahead though be sure you stir it every so often because the vinaigrette will settle to the bottom.both the boys opted for the steak – they’re such copycats!! the steak was ok – cooked fairly well – but not a patch on a good gastropub steak! check out hotel lincoln‘s or the station hotel‘s for a better steak (at a better price).and there were prayers for yaakov before elie, and chaim and shmulik after him. and now, tonight, i\\'ll say a prayer for b. - lauren\\'s cousin and for the two boys i know from our neighborhood and tonight, this time, i\\'ll also remember tonight, i’ll go and listen to the stories – of brothers from our city who have fallen; of fathers lost; of husbands who will never return.that, however, is about where i had to stop agreeing with the guy talking. this was a mental disagreement, since he wouldn’t stop talking long enough to let me say what i thought. not that i’m still bitter about it…the bottom line is that no nfl coach has a crystal ball. they can only do what they think is best at the time. sometimes things work out and sometimes they don’t. that’s why it’s called a game people!after a cold melbourne winters day after witnessing the bombers devastating anzac day defeat to the pies, my partner in crime, andy smith, and i were looking for the warmth of a good cocktail bar, a humble bartender to chat to and a tasty tipple to heat-up the cockles of our heart.secondly, some of you may read kendra\\'s (grandmother goddess of the garden) blog barely controlled chaos. this woman was touched by mimi\\'s and julian\\'s story. she felt that mimi, michelle from my semblance of sanity, and i should meet in person and she made that a reality. she was able to get all three of us tickets to oprah\\'s show! mimi, michelle, and i have been busy making our plans to meet up in chicago for the show. and then today i got an email from kendra\\'s daughter. it said that she was in the hospital and had just had emergency brain surgery to remove a tumor earlier this week. she was diagnosed with mestastatic lung cancer. :*( this was a huge shock to her. anyway, please keep kendra in your thoughts/prayers.yesterday was different. we visited the morgan car factory - a 2-hour tour that anyone can take, but this was organised by tcas as part of the \\'escape to the hills\\' weekend. what always fascinates me when on such an outing is looking behind the scenes, the organisation, the attention to detail in so many aspects of a company. this post will not be a \\'write-up\\' of morgan - a british-owned, family-run firm since 1905, every beautiful car put together by hand, skilled workforce using hand-tools - just a gallery of the snapshots i was able to take as we walked from one dedicated workshop to another. i won\\'t even caption the photos, for i cannot pretend to understand the technical aspects; hopefully such shots as i was able to take will speak for themselves. words fail me for once - though i could research it if i needed to; most of the time i couldn\\'t hear the tour guide anyway, for i lagged behind aiming for photos that showed the workmanship and not the backs of strangers!then we had the second lebanon war, with hezbollah, a semi-military organization, supported by the iranian and syrian armies, sitting on the territory of the state of lebanon, and some of its activities were terrorism, and some were guerrilla activities against soldiers.as her boss and other police are investigating her murder, our slimy funeral owner shows up to sell his famous $144.98 funeral - well, the cost before any \\'extras\\', of course. but the detective fills out the contract bottom line for 144.98 - and tells the funeral owner no \\'extras\\' are necessary.as you know, maija and sidhe are in boston this week with their school. i know they are having fun, but i must admit that it is very strange being so far away from her on her birthday! it\\'s also strange to think about my baby girl being 14 years old when i can remember so clearly just how tiny she was when we first met (8lbs 2oz and 21 inches long to be exact).rural areas, which have seen large influxes of new migrants, have been particularly hit with one force seeing arrests soar from just 27 to almost 5,000 since 2006.today i signed up for e-mail alerts when items are close to being overdue. that\\'s a lifesaver, why wasn\\'t i signed up for that earlier? i also wrote on the calendar the date the books are due back. now i just need to remember to check my calendar! so there is a price for being disorganized, i just paid mine. what\\'s yours?the reason i talk to myself is because i am the only one whose answers i accept. -george carlina feature of the documentary not all will like is that one aspect of phil parkins love of real ale paints a picture not that beer ticking is a minority sport within the ranks of camra members and beer enthusiasts but that beer ticking is a central plank and activity. you do get the impression that beer enthusiast = beer ticker, though phil’s enthusiasm and general chappish likability do add greatly to the journey he takes you on.i try to stick with as natural coloring as possible, so the bottom two layers are made completely with natural pandan extract pounded with a mortar and pestle whereas the final layer had a little help from a few drops of green coloring. i know the cream sandwiching the layers are very meagre, but that\\'s really because my brother is not a fan of cream of any sorts, and would scrap off any cream he sees on a cake, so i decided to save him the trouble by putting minimal cream in between and very \\'scrapable\\' whipped cream on the outside.was in two minds today whether to dander into town (one thing i haven\\'t mentioned is that my motor\\'s packed in). but i did as i reckon being a man of limited means and fewer prospects i will never leave the bellshite, nor, in my lifetime, get to see the denizens herein getting their two-tone psyches so lavishly catered to by such a grand american extravaganza – the last big american extravaganza of its magnitude probably being ww2.gnc lean shake is complete with well-balanced ratios of high quality protein, vitamins, minerals and fat. proven effective for weight loss, lean shake can also help reduce cholesterol and support lean muscle mass and a healthy metabolism. when used in conjunction with the provided meal and exercise plan, this delicious oat-based shake can help you achieve and maintain your weight loss goals. it features a patented fiber-rich blend that increases your feeling of fullness and satiety so you eat less and wait longer between meals. this combination of functionally-specific fibers includes oat beta-glucan. oat beta-glucan is a naturally occurring and powerful soluble fiber found in oat bran; it is known as a low-glycemic fiber that supports normal, healthy blood glucose levels. oat bran and fiber have slower and more sustained effect on blood sugar and energy levels than when consuming high-glycemic carbohydrates food such as pastries, breads or pasta.as with real estate, so with brewing, a huge aspect of a successful venture is location, location, location. jacob managed to find a place where the water was abundant and eminently suitable for brewing:first i fired 3 rounds at 50 and then another 3 at 100 yards just to get an idea of where i\\'d be hitting at those distances. i used single sheet of white paper so i\\'d have a high visibility target since my eyes are not that great.5. nebula (4:45)parenting, for me, has been like productivity boot camp and i’ve had to get pretty creative when my husband’s working late, the pasta’s boiling over, my daughter just cut her finger, my son is about dump paint on the floor, the phone rings, and the dog is begging to go out. yes, parenthood can take over at times and prevent you from doing anything else. i find, though, that when i have time, i’m very aware of what i really want to spend my precious time on, which somehow allows me to access that creative energy faster. but hey, it’s just a theory. maybe it’s just all that coffee i’ve been drinking.alluring: she shinesof course every day here looks like a sunny day you’d find front and center in a postcard and the film is super full of the values that are adored by the conservative demographic that makes up a nice portion of mr. sparks’ target audience, while still providing the sexy scenes with the sexy actors to draw in the other demos. but it kind of works as that romance in louisiana story; it’s just hurt quite a lot by the fact that the secret that logan’s keeping just looms over the whole movie even if it’s not mentioned, especially because it’s not that big a deal when you dissect it had he just told it when he arrived there. but it’s when the film tries to go all heavy-handed dramatic with beth’s ex that it’s just too bad to bear.that’s all i got folks! enjoy, and stay up late!while most of the netizens said, “it is just because of the angle that she was taken in the mv.”food changes: as you vibrate higher, you will find that you no longer want the things that you used to. coffee, tea and meat are just three of the dietary changes that people make as they begin to vibrate faster. meat is especially dense and can really affect the body’s energy, especially if it has hormones in it. you may develop cravings for certain foods, or go off your favorite foods. this is normal and a part of the change to the higher vibration. if you find this happening, then let it happen and explore the new possibilities.swigging a bit of coors light last night after seeing a six pack in the supermarket for £2. not a national offer, i think they were shifting old stock. which got me thinking that whenever i have necked this grog it’s usually an offer on old stock. its never promoted in big cheap boxes. at least it was within its sell by date, though. i used to neck this grog regularly, but that stuff was all past its sell by date. so it was interesting to compare the bouquet and flavour of the beer pre and post date. not a lot to compare really. it’s flavourless watery grog that slips down nicely. light of flavour and light on calories according to the bottle. the lady squeeze likes this one and joined me for a bottle. she even managed a belch.don\\'t forget to click on the icon for more reviews!one of the people i read about was a woman named gladys aylward. she was a poor woman from london who wanted to go to china in the 1930\\'s to be a missionary. but she had no skills, no education and she didn\\'t speak the language, so no formal organization would allow her to go.network transceivers hp procurve gigabit-sx-lc sfp (mini-gbic) transceiver module, brand hp850nm wavelengthlc connectorsfp (mini-gbic)plug-in module100% hp compatible 3rd party j4858ai didn’t love my time in the theater. in fact, after i performed in the stage version of this story, i gave up acting and changed my minor from theater to psychology. now, in retrospect, i’m damn proud to have been a small part in bringing this story to life, because the story is that good, and this film is better than just good. see this if you haven’t.this is a low-magic setting for sure. magic exists of course (excalibur, merlin, - duh!), but it tends to be more epic in nature, more rare, and truly sought after stuff. you might base a quest of a couple years on finding a rare magic sword, for instance. and no player knights can cast spells. but there are plenty of monsters to deal with. :)i created the pendant focal using an image transfer method for polymer clay. the digital image was created by lynn palazzo using one of the famous victorian \"flower girls\" (lynn, i hope you don\\'t mind me using it again, it is still my favorite!)ok, this was meant to lead up to the love letter, but it turned into a tv guide review.* pour into sterilised jars, and seal.lovingly crafted by gentle handsbecause folks showed up for session beer day in a big way, especially after only 19 days of preparation! there are brewers who are thinking up session beers now, there are bars that are reconsidering their tap set, there are drinkers who have found out that small can be beautiful...all because of session beer day.i sputtered a nervous laugh, but when he didn’t laugh, i began putting up roadblocks: that’s a big responsibility, i make an awful lot of mistakes, i really don’t know enough. it was pure panic, and it wasn’t pretty. he was unshaken. he responded to each of my protests with a patient “that’s okay”. in a last ditch effort, i suggested “how about rock star mom instead?”, to which he said “same thing.”so as we awaken to integrate the knowing of the energetic basis of the universe and in the process, heal and embrace our polarities into wholeness, we re-define the world anew. as our planet recalibrates itself into balance so must we. as we envision a new way of experiencing reality based on unity consciousness and planetary awareness, we acknowledge each other as coming from the same source. as our own science tells us, we are “bound” energy swimming in a sea of energy. let’s together shift the “programming” and open up to a new experience of the real.now that i got that out of the way, i have a serious bone to pick with lupe fiasco. as many of you know, his new album, lasers, drops next month and features a song called “words i never said”. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqkgvvrnz8at the end of the day, we cleared the space in preparation for the celebratory soiree that proceeded. food, wine, and music were all present, all of the elements needed for a great end to a great day. i’ll try to post some photos from the event at a later time, so stay tuned if interested!“oh, you are a clever one.”one of the friends moved westward to a little frontier settlement called cincinnati. one time the rumor was spread that indian bands were on the warpath. the settlers moved into the fort and armed themselves to fight the indians.zig 2 way gluethe menu said it was seasonal so you need to go try that one out before they rid of it!

the same nice looking man sitting on a park bench, reading a book, and smoking his cigarettes. when he finishes one, he starts another. i know this because after i’m finishing my walk, he’s usually lighting up another one.- i went to a party for my friend\\'s birthday party where the theme was characters that start with \"z\". i went as zack morris with a huge cell phone that i made. needless to say, most of the frenchies did not get it. at least a few of them had heard of the show! in any case, it was nice to catch up with some friends that i hadn\\'t seen since july.april\\'s book: maus by art spiegelmantip: this also tastes great piped onto fresh veggies for the tofu-phobic. just skip straight to making the bean spread, and don\\'t forget your garnishes.“i am healthy, i wrote a few books that someone somewhere in the world is reading and at least but not last i am a loved women, what more should i want.”hew kennedy was a contentious figure for the society people for his perceived abandonment of the covenanted cause, especially after he and other moderate presbyterian ministers accepted toleration under james vii’s edicts in july 1687. on 17 january 1688, james renwick handed a copy of his testimony against toleration (1688) to kennedy in an edinburgh street. (jardine, ‘united societies’, i, 182.)“we have now arrested some drivers and their helpers,” he said.so all that brings us to this silly understanding that my super expensive glasses are nothing more than a really nice tool to protect my eyes from the sun and to help me see better. the same thing is true of us. god bought us at a steep price and what good are we left a home in a protective case away from the dangers of the world.whereas the original cars tried to re-create a 50s route 66 american southwest vibe, this is a full-on 1960s british spy caper feel. everything from the supercool finn mcmissile to the gadgets to the music makes those of us old enough to remember them (or those willing to have checked them out on netflix or cable tv) the spy movies of caine, james bond or james coburn, among others. there are homages to these films scattered throughout, sometimes subtly and occasionally not so much.trick or treating didn\\'t go so well last night? sorry for the poor quality of the picture. the sun is at a position in the sky right now where i get these miserable reflections on my rear window.shape: minewho likes to walk on the wild side?the heat of the summer is more of an issue here, than winter cold. in the enclosed part, there are doors that open to screened windows to get cross ventilation. in july and august i keep an old sheet draped over the top to shield the coop from the brutal afternoon sun, since our back yard neighbor cut down their large oak tree. sometimes i wet the sheet down to help them keep cool, when we hit triple digits. ameracaunas are a good hot weather breed, as they are not very big and heavy. there are usually only a few nights in the winter when we have to rig up a heat lamp. this winter i think we only used it a total of 4 nights.all i knew was that i had to hide.2 small chiles serranos (i have never added these but i\\'m sure they\\'d be delish!)about the bookthis proposed reclassification would make crimes against animals more accessible to law enforcement officers, simplify and modernize language, toughen existing statutes, create new charges, and increase the maximum prison sentence for severe cases of animal cruelty and animal fighting.it is time for another fun challenge at cute card thursday and this week we are challenging you to use no patterned paper! omg. a little panic here at my craft desk for a second until i realised that i could make part 2 of my little alterend canvas set.right now he only has 6 bins, but i just got word from my mom that she has mailed me more shallow bins for our work box towers! yeah! so soon he can have more!amazon 347men had to act fast, else they got eaten by large, quicker things.it’s a belief held by all sane malaysians.to sign up add your blog or website to the linky with your shipping info in parenthesis following your site name.jesus forgives us and gives life again yes he doeshere is aprils moodboard.i was out all day saturday, with some of my plans for the day coming through and some not. i spent the morning and early afternoon at a huge art festival in brooklyn. from there, i had planned on going to a smaller art exhibit also in brooklyn, but the trains made it difficult. it was partly my fault; i probably could\\'ve left dumbo a half-hour earlier (that\\'s down under the manhattan bridge overpass to you non-new yorkers), but i was enjoying the day too much. still, i had to take a completely roundabout trip to greenpoint because the trains that would\\'ve gotten me there quicker weren\\'t running normally. i knew when i got off the train that i wouldn\\'t have had any time for this show, so i reluctantly chose to blow it off and head to jersey city for the highlight of the day - a return to the landmark loews jersey theater.it\\'s been an extraordinarily wet day. if this were a thomas hardy novel i\\'d be fighting for my life by now, with some unspecified fever. as it is, i just have slightly muddy trousers. having walked at least five miles before lunch, i was very glad that my lady gave me a lift home, although a part of me was quite looking forward to another martyred, wet trudge.“embedding a customer service mindset” goes beyond outward appearances, masked employees, and careful placement of sanitary facilities. the mindset depends of values – shared values of company and employee. no trading of ideas, complaints, concerns? no engagement. after all if my boss does not care about my ideas/complaints/concerns, why should i care about his? why should i engage our customers?on sunday, we were able to head south to kokomo to visit steph’s grandma and celebrate thanksgiving with her. we had a good meal and a great time seeing her; it has been awhile since she’s been able to see levi in person, but she’s been one of his strongest supporters since day one. we love you grandma, and it was so nice to spend the day with you. we are happy that it’s a short work week; later this week we will head down to celebrate thanksgiving with steph’s family, then down to my family after that. we are all looking forward to the thanksgiving holiday. it has always been my favorite. in my mind, it seems to be the last pure holiday. i know the crazy shopping commences the day after, and some families seem to jump right over it to get to the craziness of christmas quicker, but maybe that’s why i like it so much. the day is what it needs to be. it’s a day set aside to give thanks for who you are, who you’re with, what you have, and where you’re going. it’s about family, community, and reflection. add in a great meal and spice it with a little football, and there you have it. the perfect holiday. and i thank god that i can spend it with my family complete.the greatest bulwark against tyranny in america has always been the constitution, which instantiates our exquisitely designed system of private property, god-given individual liberties and free enterprise.fate, schmate.i told the group that i did not expect this result, but would remain observant and open. howard nodded in agreement. one should always keep in mind, however, that it is wise to be careful what we ask for, for we may truly receive it, and the gift of the genii is never what it seems.the skinny grupee has to be my favorite pick and might just become my all time favorite jeans. the dark blue will be replacing many of my black skinnys. i wore it with a neoprene top and a highlighter neon clutch to tie together the scuba look.in israelseen, a guest post by lee habeeb called arab like me - needs no comment, shares his interesting perspectives and the hope that \"maybe, arabs will come to see jews not as their enemies, but as their neighbors, and as their trading partners.\" - here\\'s hoping he\\'s right!a short tale, where a boy trapped in an attic is spooked out by a legion of sullen, soulless dolls. creepy at first, but it feels like it lets a little too much light in at the end.by the way, if you turn off the tv, you’ll find the world a less fearful place!1 corridorswhen will urban or national infrastructure simply become another form of advertisement?at the center of the building, where the two main corridors intersected, was a rotunda, topped with a skylight. since the floor plan was repeated on the second, mezzanine level with broad hallways with huge windows and doorways at each end, this rotunda served as a vast flue, sucking up the hot air from the interior. (the rotunda was closed up when the hotel was outfitted with air conditioning in the 1940s.)common responses that are not helpful are saying:i was immediately pleased with don antonio’s menu. vegetarian items are marked with a “(v)”, and vegan items (yes, there are vegan items at a pizza place!) are marked with a “(ve)”. there’s even a small gluten-free section.qaradawi’s activities over last decadehere’s the blurb.the roman road ruin in the picture above was part of the eastern branch of the via maris through galilee.in hamilton, no such progress. bishop said without universal standards for busing, boards differ in their policies. she feels the hamilton catholic board is unwilling to give up its generous busing policies, in the interests of saving taxpayer money.so i\\'m showing you images from the marais folder. these were my everyday stomping grounds--which is certainly a special thing to say. my favorite cheese shop was near to the st. paul metro stop. my favorite tea shop--mariage frères--was an easy stroll from my studio. my favorite teeny, tiny paris parks were quiet and welcoming every hour of the day, and whenever i needed a \"pretty fix,\" i could wander down the rue vielle du temple and stop in at le jardin moghul for their quilted, hand-block-printed rajasthani garments. that\\'s where i got pieces like the quilted jacket covered with big poppies worn a few weeks ago.women’s rights is turning out be a joke.9 \" round cake paneven though i lost my everlasting life, the reason to my happinessanother question that is difficult to answer. if i leave anyone out, i\\'m sure that i\\'ll cause offense. so, here\\'s the shortlist (living and dead combined) of what would be a veeeeeeeeeeeeery longlist: first of all, i would invite my family (including in-laws, of course) and friends. then, virgilio piñera, alberto pedro, maria luisa bemberg, tomás gutiérrez alea, chico buarque, elis regina, mario benedetti, mercedes sosa, guillermo cabrera infante, beny moré, lázaro ros, silvio rodríguez, pablo milanés, santiaguito feliú, sor juana inéz de la cruz, nicolás guillén, gigi (the ethiopian singer), susheela raman, lila downs, nelson mandela, aziza mustafa zadeh, margaret atwood, salman rushdie, hanif kureishi, leonard cohen, tom waits, rachelle ferrell, fiona apple, ben webster, art tatum, oscar peterson, freddie mercury, beverley knight, a few fellow bloggers who are regular of this parish, gandhi, martin luther king, maya angelou, malcolm x... the list goes on. that would be a hell of a party, i can assure you.depending on the sort of story you\\'re writing, this isn\\'t necessarily a problem. in a dorky sci-fi story like this one, that obviously isn\\'t taking itself too seriously, readers typically aren\\'t going to take the scientific explanations too seriously, either. if your story is magical or implausible, your readers probably won\\'t be looking for a reasonable explanation for things. j.k. rowling didn\\'t have to explain the physics that allow broomsticks to fly; stephenie meyer didn\\'t need to go into detail about exactly how many of edward\\'s internal organs still functioned normally. this little tidbit is probably most important for historical fiction and science-based novels like those by michael crichton - the history and science need to be believeable.i took my couple of steps, which is all they wanted to start with anyways, then got back in bed feeling very ill. told the nurses i wanted off that morphine pump! okay, they would switch me to demoral by mouth. it seemed okay at first, at least i wasn\\'t feeling sick.winners not only get my new book, the big ass book of crafts 2, they will get all of the colors of glitter blast sent right to their front door. just a few simple rules to enter.i looked at the short bit of roof i still had to climb. it wasn’t far. but it wasn’t like i climbed roofs for a living. i breathed again. my breath surrounding me like a cloud.it used to be that when you went over they would slow your service down so much that you could maybe get your email to open, but that was it. if you called they would sometimes let it go and reset it and other times you just had to wait twenty four hours. recently they came up with a new system where if you go over you could pay five bucks and bingo your speed has been restored or you can wait twenty four hours. since they started two months ago we have somehow gone over our limit around ten times. a few days ago i spent an hour on the phone trying to get the tech support guy to tell me what the hell they had changed so that i could avoid this. he of course assured my that nothing had changed and as a sign of good faith reset my service without charge, but i know they messed with something. somehow they changed the way they count the megabytes in order to get customers to pay a little more. right now i have no options because they have a monoploy on the market. i don\\'t really miss living in the city, but i can\\'t explain how much i miss my cable modem right now.tmd gravity manipulation gravity gun“we couldn’t be more excited to be in business with everlast. his music has been an anthem for millions of fans and songs of the ungrateful living is sure not to disappoint,” remarked michael harris evp/general manager emi global label services/caroline distribution.slick hair cuts and quifs were rifewe started with badge presentation; instead of handing out badges as they are earned, as we normally do, we saved them all up to the end of the term and had a presentation instead: nothing too fancy, we had a bag for each girl and in there was a christmas cracker, some sweeties, next term\\'s diary and newsletter and then whatever badges they had earned.starting with a wonderful loaf of going-stale bakery bread, i put together a recipe that i know will make its way into my breakfast repertoire on special occasions. when, i have a breakfast/brunch menu consisting of the usual sweet options (scones, muffins, fruit etc.), i plan on using this recipe to balance and offer guests a surprising and delightful twist on a classic.“then you’re no better than the neos!

you all know how i feel about mermaids. i really do think that disney and ariel are partially to blame for this obsession.the brass ring by mauldin - mauldin was wwii\\'s greatest cartoonisthere was edith falls. the trickle at the bottom picnic area was nothing compared to the powerful waterfall and swimming hole we had discovered. it was so picturesque... i can\\'t describe adequately how beautiful it was. there was a huge waterfall and swimming pools filled with sparkling water.we went round and round, me trying to reassure and reorient her, she denying anything i said. after she refused to let me draw blood for ordered lab work (painless for her thanks to a catheter already inserted in an artery), i ended up calling her daughter and son. they said they\\'d come up and talk to her. when i went back to her bed, she was sound asleep again. the kids showed up a little later and talked her through all the nursing care we needed to do. we went outside for a little conference.distressed edges of paper w/tim holtz distressing tooland the grand prize of an original handmade art doll by mo!

photographs she took in africa for her mother in-law’s charity, hands of hope, helped to raise thousands of dollars for them. at this point she decided to pursue photography as a profession by enrolling in classes at columbia college. the following years sarah spent traveling around the world taking photographs for various charities as sarah wauterlek photography. she has exhibited her work downtown la with raw artists and was chosen as a semi-finalist.my husband and i were anxiously awaiting our 20 week ultrasound – it was right before christmas and we could not wait to go home and tell our family the sex of the baby. right away i could tell that something was wrong. as i watched the tech measure my baby the measurements seemed so small: 17w2d head, 16w5d arm, 17w3d belly, etc. the tech then asked me why i was here so early for my 20 week ultrasound. i told her that i was 20 weeks today and that i was not early. she didn’t seem overly concerned and just reported that my dates had to be wrong. i knew that my dates were not wrong, i had had an ultrasound almost every week up until week 11 and the baby had measured correct the whole time. once my ultrasound was finished we went to talk to the doctor. he was not able to give us any information other than our baby girl was measuring four weeks behind and that her umbilical cord was a two vessel cord instead of a three vessel cord. i was told to try and gain some weight (i had only gained about 3-4 pounds thus far) and to come back in three weeks to see if she had grown. it was hard to stay optimistic over christmas. friends and family were telling us that things were going to be just fine, that she was just going to be a small baby, but this mama knew differently. i knew that there was something seriously wrong and i knew that i was never going to be bringing my baby home.waterproofs come next, and not word of a lie, my favourite cost me six euros from a decathlon store in france. it\\'s a brown pertex smock that packs the size of a large sandwich; it\\'s featherlite, windproof and even supposedly breathable - and it\\'s cut like a bin bag which means you can slip it over almost anything. they\\'re available in the uk but any pac-a-mac equivalent will do. of course, i wouldn\\'t use this as my only waterproof on a full day in the hills with a threatening sky - but for most times, when the worst that happens is you get a bit damp before heading to the caff, i\\'d pack it in preference to coat that cost fifty times more.“anyone who does not render service and neglects his

today?quinn’s fourth fabulous mystery (see walla walla suite and homicide, my own) is an excellent thriller filled with twists that keep readers wondering what next as nothing is quite like it seems. the heroine has a need to know re krapp though she wishes that wasn’t so while the bruno scenario just will not go away. with beckman encouraging her to get involved and help on his case while assisting her with the calls, readers will appreciate quinn’s adventures as she is caught in the crosshairs by the other romanian.i think see’s statement “effective technology plans focus on

however, necessity is the mother of invention and i learned several tricks that work great, including how to make my own colored sugar!here again i find myself agreeing with deirdre lefaye: it’s a collaboration (see her family record). the text is just too sharp (adult) and adept in its pulling out of precisely the most memorable scenes of pollexfen’s abduction of harriet bryon (vol 1, letter 29); astute observations about human nature from grandison on a few occasions (and scattered in the original text); strong lines (“i will not be bribed into liking your wit”); and funny ones of the type we find in her juvenilia: to me who have read grandison and written a chapter of my dissertation on this book, the best of these is his sister, charlotte, lady g, explaining why sir charles has hitherto not fallen in love or courted anyone: he hasn’t the time, “for he is constantly going from one place to another. but what for, we cannot tell”. there are lines from from vol 4, letters 14 &

strong, realistic bond with peeta. the book is very accessible to a wide audience as it has a good deal of action, suspense, and even some romance for those fans inclined to that genre. note, collis does a good job of straddling the line with the romantic angle which could easily have turned many readers off. she never gets too sappy, but does give readers looking for romance just the right amount to keep them engaged.all things considered, ghostbusters is still a abundant bold no bulk which adjustment you get. while i wouldn\\'t acclaim the red fly adjustment over the terminal

garbage, dog and cat food, dog feces, birdseed, and fruits or berries that have fallen to the ground. take away their sources of food outside, and rodents will look for another neighborhood to live. pick up fruit and vegetables in your yard. a honeycomb can feed hundreds of mice all winter, so carefully remove any beehives in the immediate area. birds are messy eaters, which is especially helpful to rodents. so quit feeding the birds for the duration of the infestation. if you’re feeding the squirrels; you’re also feeding rodents. if at all possible, feed your pets indoors. if you must feed your pets outside, remove their food 30 minutes after serving. otherwise, whatever you’re pet doesn’t eat, rodents will. since rats are nocturnal, feed your outdoor pet well before dark.chocolate

stolen property, so they can never sell it in good faith. similarly, most of the items of treasure found here should be the grave-goods of someone or other, so to keep it might prove unfortunate and

potentially soften the effects of a hangover. therefore, the ingredients were often a matter of taste. perhaps the chosen cure combined a bit of milk and sugar mixed with your morning dram. after absinthe became popular, it often found its way into many anti-fogmatics, mostly because of its refreshing flavor and stomach settling powers. its extreme potency was usually tamed with some sweetener and ice. other pick-me-ups revolved around citrus and employed its tart flavors, not to mention the natural sugars and vitamins, to help bring the sparkle back to eyes clouded over with heaviness. the truth is that when strong morning tipples were common--and we\\'re not talking about today\\'s tame bloody marys and mimosas--everything was fair game. an entire category of drinks, with clever

cooperation, and group investigations.while my odds of winning this game are not very good, i did catch a break on thursday when the mike wallace touchdown was overturned on review and antonio brown

manila to batangas. we would leave batangas very early like 4am. to get out of our house in batangas, we had to pass by the stone walls. it was dark but i tried my best to look at the cracks between the stones, vigilantly watching if a snake would come out of those cracks. our house in batangas had really tall talahib grass, so it isn’t entirely impossible that there were a couple snakes in the area. our cat once killed a baby snake under our bed. several years after, i told my mom about this fear and she was really surprised. she said “i thought you were really brave because even if it was so dark and scary, but you didn’t say a thing.” i said “i didn’t say a thing because i was trying to be brave, and i was too busy watching out for the snakes.” i am not afraid of batangas anymore.life

file this one under both “teacher” and “daddy.” as a boy growing up in the eighties, i learned united states geography through college basketball conference affiliation. some glorious weekend in october, dick vitale’s college basketball yearbook would hit the local drugstore’s magazine rack, and i would giddily grab it and run to my mother yelling “it’s here today! can i get it?!” she always said “yes,” and the stat-ogling would begin. when i grew tired of marveling at how many points reggie miller or reggie williams averaged or at the size of the carrier dome or at the enrollment at texas, i moved on to drawing uniforms and mascots. eventually, at some point, this rural kentucky boy would dig up a map of the united states and hunt for places like corvallis, oregon, or lafayette, louisiana. i made it a point to know all of the division i teams, their colors, and their mascots.1/4 teaspoon onion powderthe girls have been home for almost two hours and have been

result of the summer earthquake, the dedication was postponed from august until october. and, as soon as the monument was revealed to the public, criticism poured in. for me, the first problem was aesthetic: it was not that the image of rev. king emerging from the rock was too gray, stern or forbidding, as some critics said. (that’s just philistinism.) rather: the whole thing just seemed too cautious and tame. first, it just isn’t very well done. second, and more important: is there really a point to a conventional, representational portrait sculpture in an age in which the most powerful (and eventually popular) monuments: the vietnam memorial, the new 9-11 memorial site, and the berlin monument to the murdered jews of europe draw upon a more modern language of abstraction? the king monument, its very real appeals notwithstanding, could fit perfectly well in a neo-stalinist sculpture garden or political cemetery. (philosopher cornel west went even further, though in a very different direction, declaring that king would have wanted a “revolution,” not a monument.)for the record there are much better beers with much better names out there, sorry slaters but you just don\\'t cut it for me.i want people to be confused and angry at me03. i think i smell a rat-if i watch shows like baby story on tlc, i cry my eyes out at the joy and elation that those families are experiencing...emotions that were not present in our room when brenna was born, that were drowned out by confusion and anxiety.the first page that i did in my book was taken from my favorite florence and the machine\\'s song, \"dog days.\" there\\'s a really great line in the song where she sings: \"happiness hit her like a bullet in the back.\" it\\'s sort of how i feel when i discover i\\'m happy: it\\'s such a surprise. so i did a page using that.if it not all swp, it\\'s certainly all posh neo-colonialism. take two non-swp lovers of the brown exotic, seumas milne and the ‘right wing\\' peter oborne.to a ghost, telling a lie is like dancing a tango. the one-on-one action is stimulating as hell but an audience makes it even better.it is too sad to look back at her past, so we will remember the joy she had with her new family and remember the coming joy because everybody knows that all dogs go to heaven.even so...i never saw a sign quite like this one (above right), posted at my college campus.i can\\'t even begin to express into words on this blog how hard this has been. not only on me, but my sweet dad who loves her so much and doesn\\'t know how to make it without her.

everyone who would listen (and even those who would prefer not to listen) that this type of fiction is reprehensible. it is a slap in the face to real authors. it belittles the time and effort they spent to create very real, almost livable worlds out of thin air. i have asked my other friends (not c,k, and p) how they can look at themselves in the mirror after saying ‘i’ve read hunger games’. i

on, it’s also fairly obvious that it’s a good thing to pray for the needs of others, but it struck me that there’s a default for most of us where we ask god to do things for other people that, actually we could do for them. we heard a talk the other week where the speaker pointed out that often, maybe always, we are god’s answer to the needs of others. this is not arrogance, this is god’s idea! he wants to empower us to do his work in meeting the needs of our neighbours, our towns & quite possibly people halfway round the world. but often, we still ask god to do things that we should be doing!in the third bardo the soul encounters the lord of death, a fearsome demonic deity who appears in smoke and fire, and subjects the soul to a judgment. if the dead person protests that he has

upon the soul for his evil deeds.there seemed no way to tame this creature, it had ten gears and reversethe end result? fabulous!“there was an agreement with the white house at $800 billion in

summer holidays visiting the dead, but showing up at mr darcy\\'s house looking like refugees from glastonbury may take therapy. the house guides were very kind, possibly because we looked like people who weren\\'t really used to being indoors, and the wallpaper was lovely, but a bottle of water cost £1.50, which made me think rather more kindly about the warm, free water in buxton. it is a truth universally acknowledged that a man in possession of a large fortune probably got it by fleecing tourists.ended the day with some planning of my year. because with esteff, since she only has 3 months

saw his footsteps that led him to the cave, and traced them back around the large rock formation. trying again and again to reach his comrades. the static did not let up. he entered into the

in life, our relationship has not always come easy. we have worked hard to reach the point we are at today. one of the toughest times in our relationship was when richard had to go away for basic training. being away from each other was absolute torture for both of us. although this was one of the most difficult times for us, it also made us truly appreciate one another more. it tested our love, devotion, and loyalty to each other. when richard finally returned home we decided that there was nothing more we wanted than to spend the rest of our lives together. nine months later, our love

conclusion. first off i have to say i am very happy about this, as i’m sure are many fans. one of the big reasons for the dislike of the ending is the lack of closure, but i feel bioware should also

stories of why they had left their homes, families, children, farms and businesses behind. some people have been here for many years with still no hope of being granted the right to stay. but everyone

“unfruitful” is the same word as καρπὸς, “fruitful” or “fruit,” with a ἄ prefix. this the same thing we do in english by putting a prefix of “a” on a word to make it mean the exact opposite. so, if we put the “alpha-negative” on the front of καρπὸς, which means fruitful, we have a word that means “unfruitful, fruitless, barren, or unproductive,” and that is exactly how ἄκαρπος is used in the new testament. it is found eight times in the new testament. in the parable of the sower in matthew 13 it refers to the “thorny ground hearer.” in the book of jude it is used to refer to apostates who are “clouds…without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots…”according to mocality, within a few hours of the change going live, six

acknowledgements page of the book, but they should. their work is more visible to the reader than that of the editor or the proofreader. a useful trick for writers struggling with a book they can\\'t evaluate is to print it out in a different font. text looks different in a different font. the book you wrote in arial (yuk) or times new roman (yuk) will look quite different if you print it in goudy old style or palatino. suddenly, you can see the book with fresh eyes. now - does your book suit a spindly, spidery font or an elegant, crisp font? does that curly \\'q\\' really work? do you have to

across a new online auction site. take the auction bidding element like ebay, combining it with a live auction but do it online and you have a virtual auction site known as tophatter auction. on

being from indiana, there is something about bayh that makes me question whether he’s actually presidential material. but he is a democrat who can win in normally republican country. unlike john edwards, who had zero influence even in his own home state (as was also the case with al gore), bayh would likely take indiana and swing ohio over to the democrats, which would almost assuredly win the race.according to the letter,there was a time when my hands were numb,we\\'ve got some fantastic give prizes ... one $50, one $30, and one $20 gift certificate all from peachy keen stamps!in the mating of trees,your drifting desire.pacing is frequently a challenge, particularly for a long manga, but i think this one works despite its length largely because the cast is so diverse and complex (rather than pat standard side characters). although there is a potential for the shojo standard reverse harem (one girl with many male potential admirers), it\\'s generally more family-like with really only yuki and kyo as serious potential love interests. the side stories and complicated emotional histories of the various characters have considerable depth and, frequently, charm. sometimes, they are downright heart-wrenching and it\\'s somewhat intriguing to me how the author used the silly premise to highlight some key family interactions. momiji\\'s past (and his tohru-like acceptance) of a horrific situation was particularly touching for me.as a music consultant, i push artists to keep a weekly and monthly overall log of their social media sites when it comes to friends, adds,

stuffed with gratitude and joy!perhaps the question for the republican party is this, as it “moves to de-centralize the federal government does it want to centralize its power”? the question then becomes as we de-centralize the federal government do we want the political parties to become more centralized in power? will the members of the gop be willing to accept a centralized party which will in turn give us a more centralized government controlled by centralized parties?while we will be sad to see some favorites go,except for his creepy eugenicist ideas, chris langan seems like an

a vacuum of any context in modern bureaucracies.but now onto the why not to watch this. well for one thing, it’s only painfully obvious that this has been ripped from the pages of a book because a) it says so in the opening credits and b) you can kind of tell with hindsight that there was probably a good few important scenes that were cut but which would have made the film make a little more holistic sense. by that i mean that characters would have been fleshed out and developed more which is a dire necessity here. yes, there is mystery and you’re not supposed to know what’s going on but

director of the montreal college of classical homeopathy, and former physicist has said this of the report: “circumstances have never been as opportune as now, in the quantum era for homeopathy to come to full acceptance by western medicine. the burgeoning new field of scientific research emerging from the convergence of nanoscience, biotechnology and quantum physics is paving the way for biologists to be able to understand the level at which homeopathy induces healing responses.”the characters are all very well drawn and the first book (of the three making up the novel) describes an unusual coming-of-age story. the sex scenes are particularly well done. the plot then takes unusual and unexpected directions and the ending is moving and satisfying, leaving the reader with a sense

labor itself is nothing if not a test of strength, courage and endurance, so maintaining your fitness program, or even starting one sometime well before the doctor says, “push!” may be in your best interest. but many women find safely navigating the challenges a fitness regime for a body that, at times, can seem alien (or like it’s growing one) can be confusing and overwhelming. should you give

structured to properly assist lay people, who are not part of the “religious establishment”, to follow the personal path of discipleship the lord is calling them to follow. the modern church establishment does not expect lay people to enter into such individual callings. the establishment expects that any one who has such a call to either enter a seminary to become a priest, deacon, or minister or to join some religious order. it is difficult to overcome the prejudices of the past that have placed lay christians as passive , un-empowered, servants of the clergy, having no understanding of things spiritual.jonathan has little awning type features planned for over the windows- the rock of course need done and all the detail painting. would love a new door surround too-

soup is something legendary though. it’s like a ratatouille, and you can add extras, or change things around depending on taste; i added some smoked sausage that i had just to bulk it up, but even without that, it was plenty bulky enough. i also admit to using olive oil rather than fry light, but i can’t imagine it making much of a difference to be fair, and rather than a fresh chilli (which for some reason i couldn’t find in tesco), i found some frozen squares of minced chilli in the freezer cabinets – very useful! some weight watchers people will probably be recoiling in horror, but then i’m not looking at losing weight especially. sure i could do with trying, but i don’t want to pressurise myself – also i am surrounded by some true diet nutjobs who think about every gram of fat,

the percentage of complaints and issues were addressed. someone didn’t do the math. if you have a 5% complaint rate for in-person reps, but you have 1000 reps, but a 50% complaint rate for 100 docs using an online tool, which one has the bigger problem and should be addressed first? if you’re a stats person without time to think, you say the big old negative one, the 50% problem one. if you have a brain, you say, uh, the rep one, because while both net out at 50 complaints, the rep has a higher chance of pissing people off long term, a higher rate of conversion when done correctly, and 100 docs on an online app doesn’t make for a decent pool for stats.well, most often the answer to it all is ‘no. yes. sometimes’. some days i actually do marvel at the beauty of the rain, the flutter of a

reading a bit of it here and there. the first chapter, of course, deals with god calling humanity to a close relationship with him through the salvation offered through jesus’ sacrifice. this led me to think about the divinity of jesus. do i personally believe that, if jesus existed, he was divine? not by any means do i believe that. this prompted me to double-check the facts as to what catholics and other christian denominations believe as far as jesus’ divinity goes; of course, catholics believe jesus was divine, seeing him as half-god, half-man, which automatically disqualifies me from even considering becoming catholic, nevermind the blaring fact that jesus isn’t the messiah.here some pictures.i have to appreciate that.the journey that we started 6 years ago today changed our lives...

deadline), dramas with my mother (two car crashes in one month), dramas with selling the house etc. and i can’t write effectively when things are dire and i’m stressed to breaking point. equally, in

to turn out, she asked me to write a synopsis of the history of her illness, with more details about the later stages, for a final blog entry she wanted to make about this. the reason for my involvement was to save her time and effort; she would edit my draft to make it her own without the need to do all the writing from scratch. i began right away, but i did not get it ready for her soon enough. there was a lot going on, and we all thought we would have more time—probably a few weeks. however, i have decided finally to complete this task as best i can and get it posted for her at

decision to perform in full nazi regalia. contrary to most of the other bands in the doc, þeyr weren’t filmed during a concert. instead, an ‘acted’ ‘music video’ was used to present the band. it shows the members goose step in nazi gear towards the icelandic president\\'s house at bessastaðir in-between shots of them rocking out in their rehearsal space (which was conveniently located at álftanes,

within many of that day’s primary theological institutions. yet, like the ephesian church, while it began as a right and just movement against doctrines and practices that were contrary to scripture, the fundamentalist movement has more recently become known more for its attacks on those within and outside the church than its love for the lord and for his people.salt and pepper squid.dies:

mezzanine level around the perimeter of the cover building allows a full appreciation of the floor plan of the villa, most of whose flint and mortar foundation walls still remain to a height of a couple of feet or more. a huge number of finds are on show in display cases – from decorative beads and jewellery to more mundane finds: pottery, tools, nails, padlocks, gaming counters, household goods, geese skeletons (possibly sacrificed). and roof tiles, many of which were imprinted with foot prints of animals – dogs, cats, geese, oxen – as they lay in the sun to dry. for me, the roof tiles give perhaps the most vivid indication of what life around the villa may have been like: somewhat hectic, with animals roaming at will around a busy farmyard, geese flapping, dogs barking… and just as we gain an insight into life at lullingstone, we also glimpse death: two skeletons are on show, one of an adult male found with grave goods in a lead casket decorated with scallop-shell detail, the

an imposition seems to violate the liberty of the students. since they are adults, there is a presumption in favor of their right to dress as they choose. naturally, this should match the laws regarding public indecency (although those could be challenged as well). however, provided the students are not violating such laws, it would seem reasonable to not impose on their liberty. unless, of course, the harm done by specific attire would morally warrant imposing on the liberty of the students. this takes me to the second reason.i confess...how did you find your midwife?here’s the

novel! a completely different take on vampires, fukuda has created an intriguing, captivating, fast paced novel that readers won’t be able to put down. going into the novel, i wasn’t sure what to

anything irrelevant.... reading, at which i used to be no slouch, now gave me the most incredible, disheveled experiences of my print-bound life. now print jigged toward me, then it hung back. the one

viewed – however unfair it might be – as a judas by the usc faithful, this article is extremely confused. the mystique of the coliseum wasn’t the perceived invincibility of the trojans on their own field, it was how the hell usc fans managed to get over their collective yawning for a few years and turn the place into a semblance of home field advantage. in that respect the mystique is gone: attendance figures are falling and will continue to fall until usc is ranked in the top ten with consistency. but then there’s this: that was the loudest coliseum crowd i’ve heard in a long time. ignoring the epic failures of the spirit squad’s contemptible mouse squeaks for chanting, it was a pretty good night crowd-wise. when usc exploded at the beginning of the second half and took the lead i overcame my usual attempts at civility and screamed “choke! choke!” at the oregon fans behind me, then pointed at the silent away crowd in the southeastern end of the coliseum and screamed, “it’s ok, they’re choking too!” this is very rare, and like all prodigies it foreshadowed events of great happenstance and stature, i.e. silent, glowering hatred and despair when the ducks decided they were dangerously close to seriously messing up their points per game. still, i was proud of the 88,000 or so fans who managed to show up and, even more surprisingly, wear red. there is still some shard of

saw both of them on facebook as i was waiting on them to show up. a couple that wanted help with their marriage was supposed to meet with me today, but they had something come up. sure, these can probably be explained, but it does make you wonder about our priorities. the bible says to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and then all else will be added to it. somehow we think

evokes the “ingroup bunker mentality” as “a fundamental characteristic of jewish society.” so it was, and perhaps still is among many older jews. but to fail to limn why it’s so for exogenous and millennia-long reasons, and how it parallels the same mentality in other middleman minorities, can only be seen as a telling omission. this is even more bizarre when thomas sowell has already done the intellectual heavy lifting, e.g. here.the single “bohemian rhapsody” reached #2 on the billboard charts in the us in 1975. after it was featured prominently in the film “wayne’s world“, it again

chicken bowl (with black beans, chicken, a little cheese, and some sour cream)i look down and see what i’ve done. look carefully in there for precious stones.i understand why this movie isn’t well received. it’s schlock. the plot, the characters, everything about it is just low-grade thriller. and i don’t really love it for that; the acting included. as much as i like nicholas cage, and the role he played in moving action heroes away from the stallones and the van dammes (which was a positive in my opinion), he really does feel samey in many of his movies. this movie is no exception, and apart from being a zany actor for a odd-ball role, i can’t really see any other reason to have him as the star. i would have picked another actor for this one, not sure which one but not cage. yeah, i understand he was made for these kind of parts, but meh. he doesn’t really seem to have any chemistry with the romance and biel. speaking of biel, i don’t think i really like her as an actress. yeah, she’s gorgeous, but you need more than that to be a compelling character, and she certainly does not bring it here. the character is one-dimensional and forgettable, and i’m sorry but biel just relies too much on looks and not enough on an ability to act in my opinion. as for julianne moore, i don’t want you to think that i have something against her for this and the blindness article but i don’t think she is good in this. not because of her really, it seems like she was just not a good fit for this movie. i’m actually a bit surprised to see her in it to be honest. i do like her, just not in what i have talked about thus far.tonight, once the kiddos go down, i am out for the count.eric olthwaite: it were always raining in denley moor, except on days when it were fine; and there weren\\'t

the paratextual approach can work tremendously well on a creative level. the most obvious example in the davison era is the caves of androzani, davison’s regeneration story, which gained an entire second level of buildup and suspense from the early announcement in doctor who monthly that it would be written by robert holmes, a writer whose reputation the magazine had bolstered in its overviews of past stories. it helped, of course, that the story was phenomenally good and that the build-up to it was actually paid off by what was transmitted, but on the other hand, part of the impact the story had on fandom was undoubtedly the fact that it was built to in the way it was.first-time feature director sean durkin does not employ the standard flashback to tell martha’s story. he uses striking transitions to move between the past and present, zooming in on an item only to reveal a change of location and time upon zooming out. the twisted logic that was fed to martha daily has warped her perception of social norms and acceptable behaviour. olsen does an excellent job of portraying martha’s confusion and vulnerability. john hawkes’ depiction of the cult leader is particularly disturbing as he brainwashes the young people around him into believing the violations of their persons and the criminal behaviour they participate in is “normal.” his interactions with

of money and produce, and perhaps even military service. the deliverance prophecies of jeremiah were not for them. this caused them great distress, but it was in this state of affairs that they had a strong faith in god and sought after him, no matter what happened. now, remembering the faithfulness of god previously in the covenants, they would write up a covenant that they might obey god.*i love

easy and convenient to bring people into the fold in this way. you’ve got something they want – a free download, a product trial, etc – and they opt into your newsletter as a way to get a great deal. most people don’t think too much about giving out their email address, even knowing they are signing up for promotional offers. the trick here is not to collect email addresses but rather to attract the type of person who would appreciate your newsletter. passive sign-ups are usually only a good idea if what you have to offer via your newsletter is similar to what motivated the sign-up in the first place.hello to everyone. i can\\'t believe it is less than a month now til christmas. i think it is really important in this crazy time of year to stop and pause for a minute and see what god

highlights though have been great.....the arrival of our granddaughter alexia laine, and some relationships restored that had been a long time broken. as for the rest if you can scroll through the blogs and get a bit of an idea.i had heard about this marriage event on the radio and checked it out a couple months back. we were not sure if josh would be off that weekend, so we didn\\'t pre-order

may be short at 200 pages, but it’s dense in description. the two women are at the centre of it, and at first, i found it hard to distinguish between their two voices, so intertwined are their lives. soon however, all was clear, and the humour underneath was beginning to come through, such as in the quotes below:things have been hectic for us. (especially since david’s dad started chemo on monday for stage 3 lymphoma.) we’re paying for the wedding ourselves (we’ve both been married before but neither of us had a wedding) and we’re older (though david is actually still young–i don’t think 33 (almost 34) is old). my parents are getting their yard ready but we need to get an arch or something, as well as things like lights for the reception area, table clothes, etc. it all adds up. my parents and many of my family members are making the food for the reception, my aunt is making the cake and cupcakes, and some of our friends are helping us with the beer, wine, and liquor.boil a lot of salted water, then add noodles. cook 3-8 minutes, or until done (each type has a different cooking time, so follow the package directions if you\\'re not used to the ones you have). drain and rinse with cold water, then return to pot and toss with oil and vinegar. set aside.racked: 07-13-2007orchestra manager tanya phillips, who has been involved with the project since its 1986 inception, said some of the 300-plus players to have been through the orchestra over quarter of a century will attend - or indeed send their parents!he looks sincere, and possibly is. the crowd knows this. they hate him. drinks fly into the ring, as do rolls of toilet paper and the occasional t-shirt that shows da infamous diz in his pure face mode. there are curious chocolate-colored stains on the shirts.i will be having a second surgery to remove the rest of my thyroid and, like mentioned above, i don\\'t look forward to the surgery, the pain, the recovery or the no driving for a week...but i can do this! this also means i will have to be on thyroid hormone medication forever :( i was really hoping (before knowing about cancer) that i was going to get off without having to be on any meds, but i can do this! also, after surgery (not exactly sure how long after) i will be having the radiation iodine treatment (one for now but others will be determined as we go). the 2 weeks of eating a certain way and the 3 day isolation will be hard i\\'m sure, but i can do it! following these few things, i will have thyroglobulin tests, testing for any further cancer, and ultrasounds (and possibly other tests or scans, i won\\'t know all the details till i talk to my doc.). this will be something i will always have to keep up on (which i can do) and especially since this cancer is slow growing. it can come back after a long time of not having it.i model manage:in the article, a pub owner points this out:r 1: ch 3, work 11 dc in ring, join to top of ch 3 – (12 dc).7. face pollutioni\\'ve decided to change my drawing style. my drawing stucks when it needs perspective. so i searched for old masters, what did they do or which style they used. not surprised of course, they was using a style named \"gesture\" i was know that but i wasn\\'t know what gesture for. at the begining; i didn\\'t need something like that. but now i\\'m thinking it\\'s the only way to reach exactly what i need. i started to search and study about it by monday. i wasn\\'t able to draw gesture drawing so it didn\\'t work for me but i believe it will!people may think of the fourth of july as sitting back with a nice cold beer, and a chance to relax and visit with family. even though i get excited about these things also, i really think of those who are serving, and have served, in order for us to have a drink and share the holiday together.the british imperialism in the region was simply the proverbial straw that broke the camel\\'s back. there were other pressing matters such as the constant border wars & growing land shortages. the notable consequence relating to the abolition of slavery which might have in fact played a role in causing the great trek was that the former slaves were now wandering all over often attacking local residents. piet retief only mentioned the abolition of slavery in his manifesto in a vain attempt at getting the tacit support or understanding of the slave owning cape dutch. who in fact often looked down at the boers & ridiculed them for wanting to trek.my version:$20, a lot of time, and so much more meaningful!my grand mother helped me a lot at succeeding in my homeworks and i became head of the class which at the end of the grade got me an invitation to attend a music primary school named :ecole le plateau.summit extra pale aleno, his friend replied, \"this is good!\"warren’s life was filled with music, being taught at an early age by his father, then attending new york military academy majoring in music. he was a trombonist with his brother’s band, les brown and the band of renown until he went into the navy in world war ii where he served for 3 years. upon discharge, he entered the business end of music and joined leeds music in new york city. because of his success as a “song plugger” finding hit songs for many artists and overseeing many educational projects for leeds, he was transferred to california to open and head the leeds music office there. the company sold to mca and warren served as vice president of mca music, inc., later to become universal music, until his retirement in 1981. during his tenure, he found strangers in the night for frank sinatra, girl from ipanema for antonio carlos jobin, and helped market in the usa the innovative music album jesus christ super star, downtown by petula clark, and it’s not unusual by tom jones.knee high to a tv tray.menu tuesday doesn\\'t quite roll off the tongue like menu monday does but seeing as it was a holiday weekend and we took a much needed break via our visit to omaha this weekend, i thought i\\'d share with you what is on our menu this week.read matthew 26:17-30in the world of negotiation/gamesmanship, a \"lumpy good\" is something over which people are unwilling/unable to compromise.in fairness, the girls have very good voices. they\\'re no agnetha and anni-frid but they\\'re nice and clear nonetheless.the first surprise to me was the airport is adjacent to the main strip. most cities are built first and then they had to squeeze in an airport somewhere outside of the city. given the las vegas location in the middle of nowhere in the desert, there was plenty of space for an airport. airport itself is ordinary, but i wanted to stay in the baggage claim area of airport and just people watch! what a diversity of people congregating here. there was a man and his son wearing slick cowboy hats and they had a special hat case carrier . i reminded myself i was in the southwest now, not northeast, where cowboy hats are haute couture. but, lo and behold!

their children to and from school, and arrange every play date and outing, young finns do much more on their own. at the ymmersta school in a nearby helsinki suburb, some first-grade students trudge to school through a stand of evergreens in near darkness. at lunch, they pick out their own meals, which all schools give free, and carry the trays to lunch tables. there is no internet filter in the school library. they can walk in their socks during class, but at home even the very young are expected to lace up their own skates or put on their own skis.this is my friends little boy\\'s birthday,

read proverbs 31, we need to remember to jump ahead to the new testament. jesus - not a list of rules – makes a woman into a proverbs 31 woman. he takes a controlling woman and teaches her to put others before themselves. he indwells the lazy woman and provides her with purpose and perseverance. he gives her the mind of christ and instills wisdom in her over time. he breathes warmth into her cold heart and helps her become compassionate. he gives her strength in her weakness. he gives her dignity in her shame. the real proverbs 31 woman is simply a jesus woman.me: \"...\"mano devi is

windows, with flowers everywhere, paper lanterns hanging from the high ceilings . . . that\\'s a big difference with french weddings, they tend to be in small village halls here. though i suppose in bigger cities ballrooms in hotels might be common. restaurants are common here too, for smaller groups. out where i live, it\\'s usually in the multipurpose room across the square from the town hall. i feel like in the states, the venue is extremely important. tons of flowers in lush interiors, urban lofts with ice sculptures, lights galore in a marquee in the woods. here, the food seems to take center stage, in functional rooms with tile floors and nice but not overly ambitious decorations. and really, all of this could be regional. i have been to a wedding at a chateau, which was lovely, but there aren\\'t tons of chateaux in the area, so maybe other more chateau-y regions have nicer reception halls. and i\\'ll bet people who live closer to the beach in france use it for weddings. at

path; it will be of an idol, alone with a pain he couldn’t share or defeat. it is maddeningly ironic that seau’s death comes on the same day that 4 current and former new orleans saints players

favorite object and whyi’m not big enough to change even one single human heart. that’s what frustrates me the most. it’s my most common emotion because i’m in the business of changing hearts. it’s a family business.i’ll be posting more quotes here and on the quotes page. hope you enjoythis is what god tells us in his word – that god saved us and called us with a holy calling given us in christ before the world began. this life on earth here is not a “contest” to see “what will happen” as the result of god creating man. rather, it was decided by god before the world began. moreover, we were there as god’s elect when this was “decided”. this was given us in christ, as god’s elect, before the world began. i will go in to some scripture on that, but want to cut “right to the chase”. we see in this scripture that the purpose of this creation is centered in jesus christ before the world began. what will jesus accomplish for us?? through jesus christ, god will save us and call us (not according to our own works) but according to god’s own eternal counsel — his own purpose and grace before the world began. this, of course, is speaking of predestination being god working out his own plan towards his elect in grace. yet, the scripture tells us more. the scripture tells us that this manifestation of our salvation and holy calling is manifested by the appearing of our savior. also, that jesus christ appearing abolishes death and brings life and immortality to light through the gospel. god’s purpose and grace is to save us by abolishing (destroying into nonexistence)… death… and “giving us beauty for ashes” as some say. these human bodies were made from the dust of the ground. and we know that at the lord’s return, this mortality will put on immortality. we will gain new heavenly spiritual bodies. we who are the elect, those called out and saved in this life, will put off this earthly tabernacle and put on the heavenly tabernacle. we will experience the full redemption in our bodies in gaining new heavenly spiritual bodies at the lord’s return.is it my destiny, my fate?i had an eventful outing with my new mobility scooter yesterday, we decided it would be

documentary the pruitt igoe myth (2011) brings out the core problem brilliantly. while the st. louis housing project has become notorious as a symbol of many things—the hopelessness of public housing, the failure of liberal efforts to help the poor, and, above all, the pathology of the poor themselves—the film reveals a forgotten history. some former residents were forever scarred by their violent experiences at pruitt-igoe, but others looked back on the place with great fondness. pruitt-igoe was a step up for many of the former slum dwellers, who had left deep poverty in the south for dangerous, cramped conditions in the city. in the beginning, the projects were a sparkling mirage of upward mobility for poor families who had never had proper plumbing or electricity. it was the “poor man’s penthouse,” as one resident declared.then on 14 june 2011 armed maoists attacked sori’s 70-year-old father’s house, shot him in the leg, and ransacked his home. on september 9, lingaram

classes, i have a few observations about going to school here. who knows if these will pan out for the rest of the semester, but here’s what i’ve noticed thus far. first, being on a semester system rather than a quarter system, everything seems to move more slowly. back at uw, i would already be thinking about my first midterms. here, with 15 weeks of class, things don’t seem as rushed. second, perhaps the professors are accustomed to moroccan students who know english as a third or even fourth language. i say this because the amount of reading assigned for class in general is less than i would get in my classes at uw. from talking to other moroccan students, it takes them much longer to read the same section of a textbook, simply due to the fact that i am a native english speaker and they are not. due to these two trends, i think i’m going to have more free time than i would back home. i’m excited because this should give me the chance to join some clubs (guitar club, dj club, explorer’s club, maybe even extreme sports club) and also tryout for the basketball, tennis, and ping pong (awesome!) teams.georgia has the 3rd largest us troop contingent in the world?rather than no,

to avoid saying “breast” or “leg” – christians have found it easier to guilt others, and particularly their children, into an abstinence-only approach to sexuality, rather than attempting the much more difficult but infinitely more valuable task of cultivating a robust christian ethic of sexuality whose chief attributes are gratitude and reverence. as a result, we’re known for thinking sex is shameful.and that\\'s something else: for a director and visualiser like bakshi to create figures that are so plain and dull, so poorly conceptualized and so sloppily executed is not in keeping with

of the shows you hope to be booked in. stay for the show and approach the producer afterwards, introduce yourself and express your interest in performing there. follow up with an email and send video clips and descriptions of your act (i will go into this in more detail later). when a performer introduces themselves to me in person, it helps solidify who they are to me in my mind among a sea of faceless emails and complicated burlesque names. it also helps me to know that the performer already knows what the venue and the venue\\'s clientele are like, and more importantly, what type of acts are booked and what type of stage (or lack of) she will be dealing with.to conclude, glasman has a good grasp of what is wrong with england. he has a comprehensive understanding of the realities and

re-election and mandates of vacuous ‘change’ above anything meaningful.i was delighted when british prime minister david cameron and french president nicolas sarkozy recently expressed their

(amazon)when i was a little girl we made up little paper “vases” and filled them with spring flowers early in the morning on the first of may. then i went around the neighborhood and hung them on all the doorknobs. i loved this annual event, but had no idea what may day was supposed to be about beyond surreptitious flower deliveries. since writing about a hedge witch – or green witch – i’ve learned a lot more about this holiday.there has been something of a fightback from the traditional industry. they seem to have consolidated their investment around a highly focussed strategy where they spend a year building up to one big album release – like we saw with lana del rey this year – while pretty much ignoring the rest of their catalogues. this is pretty clever, and it does seem to work, but it has had a bit of chilling effect on the explosion in alternatives that we saw a few years back. it’s increasingly hard for artists who aren’t interested in hoop jumping to break through to public exposure. so many magazines are only kept afloat by advertising from the industry they ‘criticize’ that they just retreat to trawling back catalogues for cover stars and saving up all their bile for people who aren’t subsidizing their lifestyles. bookers can demand that festivals take their dull acts on sunday afternoon as a condition of supplying their highly publicised headliners for saturday night – effectively barring the way for better bands.god calls us and god sends us. it is interesting that we tend to focus more on our “calling” than our “sending”, and yet the bible is full of the question “who shall i send?” not “who shall i call?”8:00 – small brown bike, bridge and tunnel, my skull your closet, let me run @ cake shop $10 (21+)i soon grew to love it, and the more i loved it, the more i played it. i also think that if any one of the tracks was taken out, the album wouldn’t have been nearly as good. the second song for example, on the run, although its not really what i would call a song, i never skip it, it makes the whole album sort of bind together, it tells part of the story like a stroke of genius.pastry cream:when compulsive consumers-cum-critics praise this or that modern piece of referential art, they\\'re pretending that they\\'re spending a lot of time with it and that this is a testament to the quality of the material (they\\'re making a claim then, of the art being essential, as explained above). do not trust them, divide their claims of how much they\\'ve experienced the object of art by ten or more. if they say they\\'ve been listening to a record for two months straight, this means they\\'ve given it a half-dozen incomplete listens while surfing the internet, perhaps. the reason they\\'re lying is because they know nobody will pay any attention to their recommendations if they were truthful about how they\\'re using the product. art is still sold on the basis of essentialism even when both critic and consumer do not consume the product with mind to its essential quality. the merit of art has been sidestepped, it has become at best a selling point on a marketing sheet. what is sold and bought instead, is a brief feeling of elation, belonging, an experience of something one already is prepared to experience.troy bar, 10 hoxton st, n1 6ngdue date: may 1st5) pass the award on to 10 blogs and link to themi posted about mt ebay rocking chair mini makeover here previously. i decided to enhance it a little further with some subtle burgundy grain sack stripes.or is giving up on a poorly chosen nesting sitenamco fightstick by mad catz specs:as we continue our audit and make changes accordingly, this page will be updated to reflect the most current information. this information is current as of may 1, 2012in a quiet corner with no signs in the porsche museum in zuffenhausen, germany, are a number of fireproof vaults and a huge library. this is porsche’s dna.please copy and paste this link into your browser to learn more about litworld and the upcoming world read aloud day.40. reading what i write and giving me honest feedback.7and when the thousand years are expired, satan shall be loosed out of his prison,pink ones. i love pink.call or text us for booking/inquiry:last friday, while approaching an intersection and entering a left hand turn lane, a car coming in the other direction across the intersection drove directly into me. i saw him coming just in time and was able to swerve out of the way without hitting someone else. no harm came to me or the other car.“sun, stand still over gibeon;“love is the voice under all silences, the hope which has no opposite in fear;

thankfully it all came together. i think i\\'m alone in the wilderness in my genuine enjoyment of this long misunderstood film, which is really less of a horror film about devil cults and more a memento-style mediation on religion and righteousness. i only rank it lower than other commentaries i\\'ve done because upon listening to it, i have so many \"um\" and \"ah\" moments that the toastmasters would grill me alive; i\\'m sure that\\'s present on other commentaries i\\'ve done, but it just felt especially egregious here. well, that and i occasionally lose my focus when ms. black chooses to take the discussion in another more interesting direction. ultimately though, a long poortly-treated movie finally gets its due, and i got to help.so she proceeds to tell me she hears the violins.i\\'ll go back to reclusion. politics has become an odd religion to many, and often people bring their religion into it. left, right, and who knows. you tell me chris matthews does not have the same awe and worship of obama as any christian has of jesus. so his religion is government as it now exists, while many want to bring in christianity, islam, you name it.this book is brilliant.we\\'re sure that you remember the story of \\'lola,\\' the puppy who was thrown over a third-story balcony a few weeks ago. well, great news: she has recovered and has found a new forever home!

require an $80,000 principal payment plus $24,000 worth of interest (6% of $400,000). to meet the principal payment alone, the company would need to generate $123,077 in pre-tax earnings in order to

for overhaul. they said that they could get on it in a few days, but after eight days i called them on thursday. they said that they would get on it that afternoon. that afternoon i got a call. they could not get it apart. the threads have galled. so with a race pending next weekend, i retrieved it and reinstalled it on the boat tonight. hopefully it won\\'t leak to much. after the race, i will

educated at frensham heights school, an independent school in rowledge, near farnham in surrey, at sherborne school in sherborne in dorset, and at some other schools from which he was expelled. after school, he went to the royal academy of dramatic art (rada), from which he was also expelled after he refused to play a greek \"wind\" during one of the lessons, feeling it was a waste of both his time and his father\\'s money. he was also accused of writing graffiti about the tutors on the toilet walls. pertwee was an officer in the royal navy, spending some time working in naval intelligence during the second world war. he was a crew member of hms hood and was transferred off the ship shortly before she was sunk, losing all but three men. during his time in the navy pertwee woke up one morning after a drunken night out while in port to find a tattoo on his right arm, which was occasionally seen during his time in doctor who. after the war he made a name for himself as a comedy actor, notably on radio in waterlogged spa, alongside eric barker and puffney post office in which he played a hapless old postman with the catch-phrase \"it doesn\\'t matter what you do, as long as you tears them up\". from 1959 to 1977, he had a long-running role as the conniving chief petty officer pertwee in the navy lark on bbc radio. he was known as a danny kaye look-alike, and his impersonation of kaye can be seen in the 1949 film murder at the windmill. on stage, he played the part of lycus in the 1963 london production of a funny thing happened on the way to the forum with frankie howerd and appeared in the smaller role of crassus in the 1966 film version. he appeared as sidney tait in the 1963 comedy ladies who do and later in four carry on films: carry on cleo (1964, as the soothsayer), carry on screaming (1966, as dr. fettle), carry on cowboy (1965, as sheriff earp) and carry on columbus (1992, as the duke of costa brava). on television, he started off with small parts in children\\'s shows like mr pastry. later he made an appearance in the avengers episode \"from venus with love\" as brigadier whitehead, and in the 1970s, he guest-starred as a vicar in the goodies\\' episode \"wacky wales\". he had one of his most memorable film roles in the 1971 amicus horror compendium the house that dripped blood. filmed in the summer of 1970, between his first and second doctor who seasons, pertwee played the lead in the last segment of the film as paul henderson, a deliciously arrogant horror film star who meets his quasi-comedic doom thanks to a genuine vampire cloak.\"wanted no binds on him, so she just called him raven.on top are some family photos, a battery operated candle on a cream pedestal (doubles as a nightlight), and a vintage silverplate

the colour of the man is less important than his willingness to pay her attention, hence the women in this category tend to become impregnated and abandoned quite rapidly, and sadly, in some cases, quite frequently.you can\\'t make this stuff upnikolas’ looked around at his classmates. “uh…hey! ishaq!” a heavily built boy who was chatting with a small blonde girl turned his head.then they sent

and vegetables, old clothes, broken furniture, diapers and all manner of discarded items.\" this describes a new project by architect tadao ando called the sea forest. the sea forest \"will transform 88 hectares of reclaimed land, a 30-meter deep mound of alternating layers of landfill, into a dense forest of nearly half a million trees\" in tokyo bay. ando adds that it is also an experiment in climate-engineering, or weather control as the future of urban design: \"not only will [the forest] become a refreshing retreat for stressed out city workers, it will also create a cool ocean breeze to sweep through the capital and cool its sweaty denizens in summer.\"however the previous administration’s minister of water affairs, lindiwe hendricks, that’s the militantly-angry lady on the far

child, it speaks to the larger of problem of abuse as a whole within our society. it speaks of the disrespectful, demeaning, and dehumanizing behavior we see in so many aspects of our lives. it speaks of the way so many of us have decided that abuse such as this, in many guises and many situations, is okay. we hold children to a higher standard than we hold ourselves, through coercion and manipulation. we hit kids in the name of teaching them lessons and responsibility. we distance ourselves emotionally from our children through belittling them and prioritizing our needs and wants over theirs. and we tell them that we do it all out of love.gonzalesso i want to thank everyone — bpc members and others — who’ve supported these efforts by submitting images and content, reading and

language of the prophets is taken from the analogy between the world natural and an empire or kingdom considered as a world politic. accordingly, the world natural, consisting of heaven and earth, signifies the whole world politic, consisting of thrones and people, or so much of it as is considered in prophecy; and the things in that world signify the analogous things in this. for the heavens and the things therein signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them: and the earth, with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the lowest parts of the earth, called hades or hell, the lowest or most miserable part of them. great earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and earth, are put for the shaking of kingdoms, so as to distract and overthrow them; the creating of a new heaven and earth, and the passing of an old one; or the beginning and end of a world, for the rise and ruin of a body politic signified thereby. the sun, for the whole species and race of kings, in

portions, however, most of the ingredients would be hard to find in a supermarket (lemon infused sultanas anyone?!) and from a health shop it would probably cost you that much to walk through the door! for me, prior to losing weight, i think on average i would spend at least £5 per weekend on junk, and that would just be weekends. i never realised before, but junk is costly! for me, graze

voice says: “being reborn’s our first obligation.” the first voice speaks out again: “if they fight us, we could possibly terminate.” an elderly gruff voice booms out: “make a deal. do this and then be reborn.” woman’s voice: “that’s a gamble, also.” elderly man replies: “just want to hang out here and watch second hand adventures?” russell grins, “yeah…, right. i prefer you all just quietly watch. i know capable mortals who’ll help me. you know them. they won’t get upset at the sight of me and you know i’ll dodge anything hazardous. finding these spirits will be easy. this is my

stabbing someone constitutes violent physical discrimination in any case. the automatic assumption of “racism” can easily be a false trail. so while offensive language might be a useful guide as to whether a crime was racially motivated, it should, in my opinion, be seen as one of a number of factors, to be corroborated before any final conclusion can be drawn.never included in the dramafrom the

france’ were really radicalised – then france would certainly know about it. is it really that simple? the population of france is still, i think, around sixty million. it also has an army, a strong police force, a security service and all the rest. taking into account all these things, even a sizable minority of six million muslims would still think twice about an overwhelming show of force against the french government or against the millions of non-muslim french citizens. radical islamists know that because there are no mountains to hide in, as there are in pakistan and afghanistan, an overwhelming or systematic attack on the french government, or the french people, would be pretty unwise, to say the least. it would quite simply be crushed. thus small acts of terrorism and the rest is all the islamists have to go on in france and indeed in the uk. anything more than that would simply backfire. so what is burke expecting these radicalised muslims to do (even if we take them to be radicalised)? even one million radicalised muslims would not be foolish enough to take on a centralised government, with its army, police, etc. and a country of sixty million people. and, as i argued before, it could be the case that there is a million radicalised muslims in france (or england), but even then only a few thousand or so would be actively radical.of course, there are a load of

question is are all prospective nursing employees portraying their skills and experience accurately? when new nursing staff join any particular area of a hospital they become the focus of attention. a

don\\'t think it\\'s just because of the new baby, because he was fine the first week. but with no one available to keep track of when he might need to go, physically lead him over to the potty, and sit down and read to him until he goes ... he\\'s just not into it. if i just call from the couch \"please sit on the potty!\" it does not work at all. and he just doesn\\'t seem to know when to go on his own. after the time when he peed on a stack of library books, and the time when he begged to be on my lap and peed on that, and the time when he sat in the baby\\'s carseat and peed in that, i finally decided i was done with this, for now. i don\\'t mind cleaning puddles off the floor -- it\\'s a heck of a lot easier than changing a diaper -- but they don\\'t always end up on the floor, but the couch, the clean laundry, his toys .... you can imagine, i\\'m sure. so i put him back in diapers.including a select group of letterpress invitations,- kelenna azubuike and chuck hayes were the

turn around, though i was tensed for the smallest of noises which might indicate that they had even merely turned around to watch me go, their prey; i consciously identified as “the prey” during this ordeal. i heard the single crackle of a twig but i did not turn around, instead i laughed into the phone at some pretended bon mot. the tension was achingly palpable and i feared that to run would blow my confidence act and trigger a chase, if they sensed fear they’d know i was meeting no one on the trail, my charade would collapse, so i continued the “call” all the way to the parking lot and then, suddenly, i was running to the car, shoving jamoka in the back seat, and hitting the button that locks all the doors.a highly sought after beauty specialist, leaine founded skinsations spa in

my cat. two of these i get to incorporate into my college life. the latter, a long distance relationship that leaves us both with strained hearts, i am sure. i indulge in breakfast, lunch, and dinner

i’ll remember. he is absolutely perfect in this film – he never puts a foot wrong, there’s humour, sadness, pomposity, desire (for both a woman, and for a more interesting life), and pride, all kept spinning, and deftly turned to when needed. i’d imagine it must be difficult to take the audience with a character who isn’t always likeable – just how far do you take them with you before they cease

oh, the house-spider season has started officially. i was sitting on my bed this morning when a large one came legging it over the top of my bolster cushion and across the duvet! i am a lot better about large spiders than i used to be though and i\\'m not sure if this is because of the therapist i went to see in 2004 after nearly killing myself on the stairs after finding a spider under a cuddly toy, or because of my children, who are pretty relaxed around spiders. when the children were little, i used to deliberately go on \"spider-finding-missions\" where i would find a garden spider and show it to the baby/toddler and point out all the pretty stripes and colours and give it a cute little voice! likewise, i used to try to hide my terror when finding a large spider in the house as i really didn\\'t want to pass this phobia onto the next generation. anyway, it worked and now i have children who can safely catch the big spiders and take them outside for me and watching the children being relaxed is slowly making me feel happier. all the same, i\\'ll be glad when the spiders settle down into their winter homes and stop dashing across the floors and surprising me in the shower!! eeek!!when someone asks god, into their heart they are considered (baby christians) this is a very tender time for a new christian and the devil knows this so this is where faith comes into place because you will make sinful mistakes because no christian is perfect… when you do make a mistake speak out to god, (pray) and repent for your sinful action and ask god to help you learn from your mistake…2. rouleaux aux épinardswhile they were killedi had never gone kayaking before and it was an enriching experience – truely inspiring. it didn’t matter that i was travelling alone, the kayaking operator hooked me up with another person. if anyone is heading that way, a few tips for noting.mash the bananas, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and cloves together in a large bowl with a fork until well combined. stir in the melted butter and vanilla extract, then fold in the flour mixture until a batter forms and no dry lumps remain. pour into the prepared loaf pans.we had our friends tap and maggie over for dinner on saturday and, as it turns out, they love games just like we do. i was glad to hear that they have hosted \"game nights\" at their house in the past-- even though it was mainly trifling things such as yahtzee, scrabble, and the like.in a shelter with others who long for a home.there are times in our lives when the storm moves through quickly, other times when it seems to settle around us and rain for months. sometimes, we continue moving ahead, slowing a bit perhaps, but still focused forward. there are other times when we need to wait upon the lord, praying that he will give us greater vision and wait for him to clear the way. it is seldom in life that we gain greater advantage by pushing blindly ahead, not compelled by faith and wisdom, but driven by the stubbornness of our own determination.the image below was taken during my long meander up and down montmartre, eventually wandering down rue caulaincourt heading for the montmartre cemetery.and that’s where i stopped. i couldn’t figure out how to get back to the main idea. i wasn’t even still sure the main idea had enough meat to make a full blog out of it. seems more like a short bit in a hacky stand-up special, which… kind of undercuts my point about taking the easy way, doesn’t it?it came up today, he responded.she rolled her eyes. it was so obvious. \"because all the houses are different distances from the post office!

give them a try, because i know you will, too!!i work with a group of students — exceptional students — who require an exceptional amount of services. sadly, the learning disabilities most of these children face means they likely won’t pass a single dcas test in their life — unless perhaps by chance. some of my students really like to press those buttons!norm gets one star bullet so it of course covers his big \\'61. he was drafted by the bears in the 13th round but opted for the sox instead.took us a bit to get the hang of the sander...they told us to go slow but in the process we ruined lots of those pricey sanding pads because of some faulty advice.both of these sides of the coin – the ineffectiveness of our ‘correctional institutions’ and corruption in the juridical process combine to ensure there are more victims. not just from people who offend a second time, but also people who cannot, or do not dare to seek help before they commit a crime. how can you ask for help when the system will simply mark you as dangerous and then systematically take your life apart?mum is back in hospital after falling, her carer found her yesterday morning, she must have fallen before going to bed and had been on the floor all night. apparently she managed to say she wanted the paramedics and to go to the “nice” hospital!

devastating losses in the 1980s behind qb john elway. for many, that might not be a problem, and cleveland’s sports bars are likely to be crowded by fans watching and hoping for a miracle from the tebow-led broncos.he points out that the message is that people are sinful, they must repent and believe on christ, and that it will be costly to follow him. while sharing the good news, we must communicate the urgency of their need for jesus, as well as explaining that all of the sacrifice involved in being a disciple of christ will be worthwhile. we must base our appeals on scripture, and

me your papers” law is sui generis: it’s seen as one angry border state’s response to its outsized share of america’s illegal immigration crisis. but to label this development “arizona’s folly” trivializes its import and reach. the more you examine the law’s provisions and proponents, the more you realize that it’s the latest and (so far) most vicious battle in a far broader movement that is not just about illegal immigrants — and that is steadily increasing its annexation of one of america’s two major political parties.the rest is as argument-free and as invective-filled as the

of shawn ritenour’s foundations of economics examines what happens when the supply or demand of a good or service in the marketplace changes. ritenour makes the point that confusion sometimes results from a change in market prices. when the price of, say, coffee rises, this is not necessarily indicative of a rise in demand. demand may be exactly the same as before, but a reduction of supply may have led to the price increase. the reverse is also true; a price may change even though supply is constant if demand changes.breakfast stout ‘091 whole chicken, cut into 8 piecesconservatives also love to remind us of the intense scientific debate surrounding these issues, especially global warming. however, regarding global warming, an accurate depiction of the debate would look something like

any country, but that is particularly true for mauritania, which suffers from serious deficits in governance and an easy availability of arms. the insecurity is even more pronounced in the north of the country given its proximity to the western sahara, a conflict-ridden territory. cross\\xadborder traffic of illicit products with the western sahara has been a booming industry, with the polisario front, which is fighting for the western sahara’s independence from morocco, dominating the supply side of arms to mauritania. a 2008 report by the mauritanian department of national security estimates that the number of uncontrolled weapons in mauritania stands at 70,000. this “has led to a wave of criminality due to the fact that it is easier and easier to procure arms of different types and calibres, including weapons of war,” according to a study by the small arms survey.* they extensively encoded prophecies of this cycle, and its ultimate effects, in dozens of ancient myths

made a film about the way she was able to interest western classical ballet dancers in his unique talent, and how a group of people joined together to get him the training and then the exposure he needs. he is now a coveted ballet dancer in the states and yet he has kept close ties with his roots back in cambodia and works bringing dance and, thereby, a better life to the children there. this is an amazing story. the film is called dancing across borders, and i urge you to go read about the film and the story behind it here. and in the meantime, check this out:so i’ll probably work a bit –

your values upside down”, which took an in-depth look at “the quantum moment”. a group of men and women were studied and surveyed about their life values, both before and after experiencing a peak experience or quantum moment. the entire group was followed over a lifetime and the findings show collectively:finding my gracious curving suitsduring week one i had spanish with a professor who, in a

to pay his father the compliment of calling him “father,” but will not presume to ask to be treated as a son again. and that his planned confession lists the offended parties in the right order — “i sinned against heaven and against you.” but he has not yet totally surrendered: the son wants to be a hired servant; to do his father the justice of making restitution. now restitution is a good thing as far as it goes, but the son’s plan overlooks that he cannot put a price tag on his father’s agony. to that extent he still doesn’t see the full gravity of his offense; he knows he has wronged his father, but he still thinks himself competent to judge his wrong and his father’s loss, and to sentence himself to repayment of squandered property. in short, he’s still attached to some idea of right, and the desire to captain his own ship. with these things in mind he goes home.simonetti is adamant that he\\'s not seeking enrichment, just a replacement car as similar as possible to the one

noon or so we were all talking/hanging out, when i noticed, “mike”. i had seen him earlier in his wheelchair but had been praying for someone else. i’m always a little reserved/hesitant to pray for people in wheelchairs. my faith typically shrinks by the reality of “wheelchair” rather than the reality of “god”. forgive us, abba. i grabbed sammy and we went over to mike and asked what had happened. he shared the story of his return to the bronx last december from a vacation out west. while in the cab ride back from the airport a large delivery truck had smashed into the cab. both his legs were crushed from the knees down. the doctor did not anticipate salvaging his legs. surgery was successful (praise god!) although he had not been able to use his legs at all since. they had just checked his legs two weeks prior and told him that his legs were in no condition to carry his body. over the past year both legs had felt completely numb with no feeling whatsoever other than pain. i thanked him for sharing his story and asked if we could pray over his legs. he agreed (btw – i’ve found most people will let you pray over them especially when you approach them in genuine compassion and ask them about their condition/problem/etc.) we began praying a short prayer commanding his legs to be made whole. pain leave, muscles, bones, tendons be strengthened. legs work and operate the way you were made to! then i asked mike what he was feeling. he said, “you know, it’s funny. it’s almost like someone shot electricity down my knee caps into my legs.” i asked if he normally felt these “shocks”. he responded that he had never in his life felt anything like them. ha! it’s on! the first sign of an instant healing miracle is often something happening in a person’s body that is completely out of the ordinary (such as heat, cooling, electricity, buzzing). it’s not always the case that they feel something, but often they do. either way, if you have a heart to see people healed, don’t let feelings dictate what you believe about god’s character and heart for others. just because we don’t “feel” anything, doesn’t mean god isn’t actively at work.bought a yoga class punch

arabian nights march 31st. the balboa theatre also grabs a hold of hugo this sunday when it celebrates its 86th birthday. the tradition of showing a silent film during their annual bash continues, this year with a 35mm print of harold lloyd in safety last, the film from which comes the iconic image of a bespectacled wall-crawler hanging off a giant department store clock. hugo presents this image prominently as well, when its main characters attend a film screening (although in the original book they attend the rene clair film le million.) past balboa birthday parties (i\\'ve attended three over the years) have been some of the best value-for-ticket-dollar experiences i\\'ve had on frisco bay. not only is there a feature film with live musical accompaniment, but also other live entertainment, cake, door prizes and the opportunity for trivia prizes as well. last year i made quite a haul, and would\\'ve even if i hadn\\'t known my charlie chaplin trivia.like most gardeners, i have a surplus of seed from years past. so i went easy in my ordering this time around. i only purchased from one company, my favorite, baker creek, and chose a small handful of things i have been

why i never stood up against the injustice and reported the domestic violence that rocked their home daily.there are many examples of this contemporary mindset, but one especially obvious one can be found in the financial black hole of our modern education institutions. in these cauldrons of loveless envy, god and objective truth have been expelled while simultaneously attempting to hold fast to ethics. this of course is folly. lewis has another famous and astute point regarding this:being a clumsy boythese two procedures may be overly cautious — done for all to protect the very, very few — but neither have been proven dangerous. an argument could be made for rolling with hospital policy, if only to keep your blood pressure down at a time when you’ll be dealing with enough stress. if you want to avoid routine post-natal medication, first talk to your obstetrician or midwife well before the birth (before thirty-five weeks) about whether you have a choice in the matter, and if so, what he or she recommends for you. if you feel really strongly about this issue, you could consider a home birth where you’d have more say in the matter. otherwise, you can find safety (or solace?) in numbers: the overwhelming majority of babies are given both treatments, and are apparently none the worse for it.barisan nasional grassroots leaders, increasingly disconcerted by the reach of radio free sarawak (rfs) in the interior of sarawak, are claiming that the news aired by the internet broadcasting network is “poisoning” the “mentality” of the native dayaks.1. remember that excrutiating

it wholeheartedly, i still haven\\'t quite come to terms with the fact my first-born isn\\'t at home with me and making glittery play dough, day in and day out. and her new way of talking doesn\\'t sit pretty with me either, you know, where every sentence goes up at the end. i don\\'t like the whole having to wear black shoes thing either.i love the idea behind the big brain club! tell us about it and why programs like this are so important to students.ah yes, anyways… i think we all are familiar with the infamous “scyfy b-movie” (scyfy being klingon for “intentionally stupid”, one assume). i certainly am. with random monsters, awful acting, a lot of boobs, horrid writing, a lot of boobs, gore, boobs, and boobs, there are rather entertaining affairs. certainly comedic. however, i find the internet is gradually circumventing television in my life, due to the damn intercommies who need to learn their fucking place, thus preventing me from indulging in such guilty pleasures.①・・・shiena(italian greyhound)using a a6 card blank as a base, i used the paper i had dotted with mica powder as the background and the images really \\'popped\\' off the page. the fence is

my next step was to begin a resource website for women. i thought it was foolish. i mean, how could i help women when i was so down and out myself? but i love writing and research and building websites so i decided that it wouldn’t hurt to try.i came up with the name my savvy sisters because i wanted to reach a caliber of women who were strategic in their life goals and hell bent on achieving their dreams. i wanted to teach women how to survive anything and i wanted to show them how to overcome their personal obstacles. in essence, i wanted to give the very assistance that i needed so much at the time. these ladies would become my sisters and after much growing together, my savvy sisters, because we will be indestructible and wise enough to turn any situation into a

stickles diamond‘fusion junction’ is an interesting art book dedicated to a niche genre - game and comic book character design. since the steep rise in graphic capabilities in games there has also been a corresponding rise in expectation of detail and quality in character design. comic book art has also metamorphosed since the ‘golden’ and ‘silver’ age of the 1950′s. comics now offer a wide and often radical difference in art styles, often reflecting the mood of the story lines. ‘fusion junction’ celebrates the achievements of these artists, who are sometimes overlooked due to the commercial aspect of their art.also, bonus, as of today i have officially lost 12 pounds since i was last weighed the morning of my surgery. granted, a clear liquid diet for 5 days followed by being too nauseous and weak to eat much of anything is probably not the best diet plan, but that is what happened and i plan to not let my suffering go to waste and remain on this weight loss trajectory, only maybe at a slightly more realistic pace.the timing of mr breitbart’s death and the existence of the video caused dozens of conspiracy theorists to claim that president obama was somehow linked to his death.the last two weeks were wonderful but crazy. i\\'m sure i\\'m not alone in this. i sat down for a bit this morning as i pondered...things. i couldn\\'t decide if i wanted to reflect on the christmas

principle and warned the people of what this action would encourage from god. the people repented and returned the money gained through usury.somewhere along the way i got my funny bone but i still hate it when people tell me jokes. i feel obligated to laugh and 9/10 times i don\\'t think the joke is funny(i get the joke i just don\\'t like the joke). the only jokes i think are hilarious are the ones my kids told me when they were really little and we were in the car on a long road trip. they went something like: knock, knock! (who\\'s there) car! (car who?) car butt that was blue with treetops! har,har,har! and...and...snot with rainbow boogers and..and... (those random bits of what my little ones thought were so hilarious i too thought were hilarious!) so i am a joke snob i suppose but only 5yr and under jokes do i find funny!so this week we have been helping out front of house with the local production of guys and dolls, which is fab! we are normally in these shows but we had a break this year. however, show week has been just as busy for us with that and other things. and when we haven\\'t been there, we have been watching other shows!no we can\\'t talk at all.martin killing tops u.s. news coverage; accounts sharply differi guess i can give a general update of the things going on around here, at least…to the restoration he provides.at the tail end of this a-z challenge, i can openly say i do not know where this blog is headed. and yet i cannot care at all that i don’t know. let’s just keep on going.i started saving £5 a month many years ago when i earned £80 per week, my rent was £40 of that. it was back breaking work and very hard to put that £5 aside, but i did it. the years went by and i increased the amounts as i could, i couldn’t yet afford a pension yet so at least i thought i should increase the savings slowly.but that doesn\\'t stop me from yearning for their return. you see, i may be from detroit but my paternal grandmother was raised in brooklyn. i vaguely remember the stories she would tell me as a very young boy. they may not have been on top during her time in this borough.

we make each other better day by day. iron sharpens iron, you know. she has always been here for me, regardless of how much i have ever hurt her, and i am trying to make that up to her. last spring, i pretty much gave up on everything and everyone. i focused so much on school and work only, that i lost track of who i was, and where i wanted to be. i threw everything on the ground and turned and walked away. when i opened my eyes to my stubborn pride, she was one of a very small group of people still there when i turned back to survey the damage i had done. we had a huge heart to heart; we both cried. she tried to apologize because she has a sweet heart like that. i really hope that never changes.the annaberg sugar mill plantation ruins comprise the annaberg historic district in the virgin islands national park. sugar plantations were abundant in this region throughout the 19th century. though originally grown in india, columbus brought sugar to the caribbean, where it thrived. you’ve heard “cotton was king” in reference to the us south. well, here “sugar was king.” in 1758, a dutch immigrant, salomon zeeger, purchased the property and named it annaberg in honor of his wife anna. though its namesake, the zeegers did not construct the mill, which dates to ca. 1800. an irish merchant,james murphy, purchased many adjacent properties, including annaberg, to create his sugar estate. sugar product continued on the plantation long after his death in 1808.i offer one final, fresh example of odd behaviour by the telegraph. over the last 36 hours, i have noticed this: every time prince andrew has been described as ‘worried’ about his role as a trade envoy – or cameron has been described as being told to ‘get a grip’ about the issue – the online edition has not allowed comments. the more shrill the paper becomes about it, the more suspicious i become of gallagher’s compulsive desire to bury the prince’s reputation.the incarnation is a difficult doctrine to come to grips with. by the incarnation we’re referring to the event of god becoming a man in the person of jesus of nazareth. part of the reason for this difficulty is because there is a whole bunch of technical terminology that is flung around that needs to be understood. and a lot of these technical terms refer to specific ways of understanding the incarnation that, for one reason or another, don’t express the way the bible speaks about the person of jesus.earth people around the circle,damodar asked, hi amit, is there any particular etiquette to follow for a telephone interview?#2: a drunken man --- don\\'t like the look nor the smell.mega round of applause to samantha, thank you for sharing with us today!but ladies, be honest, am i on the road to schlumpadinkaville? is it the beginning of one of those times when, before you know it, you don’t even recognize your cute former self? then, in a desperate attempt to try to get you help, your family nominates you for one of those makeover shows where everyone is gasping at how you let yourself go?if you do it first, they can’t do it to you: they can’t tell you anything you don’t already know, or hurt you any more than you have already hurt yourself. if you do it, you can do it right: you can make a list longer than they would ever have thought of, so there is no possible way they can come up with something new, some unguarded fleshy spot into which they can slip the knife. if you do it yourself, everything is scar tissue, tough as rope you have already hung yourself with in every possible way.this past season, he took the starting job from kyle orton at halftime of the week 5 game vs the chargers and nearly led the 1-3 broncos to victory.i still see little babies when i think about you but you reallythe court was told the victim had told hondros earlier that day she was under 16.sometimes i wish i was a dancer. when my senses catch music, there is a sensational exhilaration that overtakes me, leaves me overwhelmed. i can feel my every muscle ache, yearning to break into a rigorous dance sequence. every beats gets attention, every rhythm is felt through and through. every word of every song is paid heed to. music makes me lose control, true. dancing makes me completely frenzy. even if im engulfed with work or exhausted, the ripples in music hits me like a disease. it starts from my toes, runs up to my knees, settles on the hips and sends signals to the arms and before you know it, i’ve caught it. i am so passionate about it, shame;

cut the number of \\'foreigners\\' coming into the country? no way jose! cut the number of policemen!! yes, that\\'s right - allow all the riff-raff in to commit serious crimes, leach off the welfare and then encourage more bad behaviour by cutting down on the police force! gotta love this new pc world we live in. don\\'t cut down on foreign aid, un and climate change financial support - rather cut down on internal policing. me thinks that a trip to the uk has just come off my list of potential holiday destinations - i\\'d rather go to the australian outback and say hi to some feral camels and hop with the kangaroos - seems i may be safer....i am discussing this with my seventeen year oldabortion should be an health issue between the woman, doctor and her partner. no one should be able tell any women what she can or cannot do with her reproductive system or body.i am a sucker for a good inspirational quote. i have them all over my house. an inspiration board is a great place to have all the things you love displayed. this board makes me happy and everything on it inspires me and reminds me how much i love design!first of all richard bandler is just a genius; he has a way of talking and drawing you in and changing how you feel about yourself without you even knowing about it! after only a few hours i was sat over lunch wondering why on earth i had had such a bad week and struggling to remember what it was i had been worried about a few days before!she calls, says she has to give me a whole bag of iv fluid first so baby and mine heart rate doesn\\'t go down. that takes 30 minuets. than takes over another 30 minuets for the anesthesiologist to get there. once she is in there the contractions are so so intense. my whole body is shaking, i\\'m literally convulsing and can\\'t help it. i ask davey for a barf bag. i didn\\'t throw up but really felt like i was going to. contractions are about every 30-45 seconds apart. i feel a lot more pressure with each one, not quit yet like i was ready to push, but just feel more pressure, like the baby is moving down.night of joy is a contemporary christian music festival that takes place each fall at magic king- dom park. it features live performances by con- temporary christian superstars in rock, pop and gospel.now to be fair there\\'s nothing whatsoever in the way of decent cuisine going on in nevada...or if there is it\\'s guarded more closely than the secret of the wu tang clan. no, there isn\\'t, you folks who are saying what about those fancy restaurants in the big name casinos. it all comes off the same truck. it\\'s all food service. it doesn\\'t make that much difference who is back there setting it on fire when what they\\'re starting out with is identically sourced and identically average.i must confess to being a little surprised that there weren\\'t more entries, but i\\'m going to chalk it up to the fact that i was overwhelmed by tla the last 2 weeks and wasn\\'t able to post a flurry of nagging reminders.thanks for stopping in and enjoy the rest of your week!for the most part, i feel that parenting is a two-person job. i understand there are many single mothers and fathers out there doing a phenomenal job and i would never discredit their commitments to parenting — i just feel (and have interpreted such sentiments from the sentiments of single parents) that single parents are often times playing a dual role in parenting, understanding that it is a dual role. i genuinely believe a boy without a father will seek out a male role model despite having a loving, strong mother. perhaps that means keeping him active in sports, under coaching, but i believe that. i also believe that there is no greater love, and should be no greater love than a mothers love for her child — carrying and delivering a life that has only known the sound of your voice and heart beat, you are the origin of our absolute existence. cherish that despite however ungrateful we may be at times. i promise you, we all come to appreciate it one day. eventually. hopefully. (if you haven’t you better!)but freeman is neither unremarkable nor bloodless. hearing him live is like taking a tour of a fun house: you never know what you’ll find behind the next door.we also got a couple of excellent meals in phoenix—i highly recommend matt\\'s big breakfast (which has been featured on guy fieri\\'s show) and pizzeria bianco. you will wait an exceptionally long time at both places (the wait can run up to four hours at pizzeria bianco), but you will get a meal that is so worth it in both cases.-a kitchen that is already laid out well1 cup strawberries, hulls intactso, do you want to become a better blogger and to blog better right? i know that it was not easy to blog, especially for newbie’s. blogging is one of the greatest way to make more money, and blogging is one of the best way to make a living on the internet.standard robot classesthat cerebellar tremor is the reason i put up with the drinking for so long. i have no concept of what it would be like to have my right arm be nearly useless when i try to move it. drinking alcohol was the only thing that helped calm the tremors. ironically, the doctors have noted this as well. my husband went to a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders looking for some hope. the doctor said “there’s not a lot out there that will help your arm. alcohol will but you run the risk of becoming an alcoholic.”lets\\' see if we can shed some light (once again) on the decimation of local breweries...the news first came weeks before the filming of reno 911! season six. the show creators thomas lennon, robert ben garant and kerri kenney-silver has delivered the ending to season five cliffhanger. deputy james garcia, deputy clementine johnson and deputy cherisha kimball were killed at the taco stand accident. shocker!row 17- ch3, turn, repeat row 16twq (the weekend question) asks what irritating things neighbours have been up to where you are.first, understand the value of what you bring to the table. do your homework and investigate your competitive advantages. how urgent is the need for what you’re selling? who else can match or possibly exceed you in quality, expertise, price and/or timing?salmon were brought in from the pacific ocean.finally, even if — as keystone critics argue — some canadian oil were refined in the united states and then exported, this would be a good thing. the exports would probably go mostly to latin america. they would keep well-paid industrial jobs (yes, refining) in the united states and reduce our trade deficit in oil, which exceeded $300 billion in 2011.maybe that is a question for rover.i say all this not so anyone will feel sorry for us, but because we recognize where one of the things that we really need as a couple is time to get away. time to just be us and have focused time on being together and remembering all of the reasons we ever fell in love in the first place.caterham’s upright is fairly typical of most contemporary f1 designs. by regulation all f1 cars have to use aluminum for their uprights. this one appears to be a fully machined or perhaps a cast part. before the restriction to aluminum, investment cast ti or mmc were common.it’s just a drop in the oceanwhat was i trying to do? play with middle class malaise. (what else?)i’m not going to quote when harry met sally; it’s out-dated. have you seen meg ryan lately? so listen up: if you try to be friends with a guy, one of you will end up wanting the other. the only exception is if he knew you in/before high school. in other words, before your nose job or dental braces.there is so much to share that i will separate it into several posts so as not to overwhelm anybody with tmi, including myself.and, finally, it was accepted and there was quite a tradefor the price of the kedondong and that of the other products available this week, go to the weekly product and price list, in pdf, below.i hope to have this baby look good as new, with a fun candy skein logo on the face plate in no time (or when i can find time before the middle of april). each slot can hold mini skeins in different colorways!! i\\'m so excited about it, i can\\'t even explain to you. it was a little pricey, even after getting 10% knocked off, but i knew i had to have it after some great debate. it\\'s one of those things that you know if you walk away, you won\\'t stop thinking about it. then when you go back? of course it will be gone. it\\'s not every day you see one of these.sometimes what seems like a straightforward answer to a question leads to more complex issues. for example, an fc&s subscriber recently asked us the following regarding a claim on a businessowners form:if we let them.but those whose desires exceed those limits are transgressors;-she speaks in sentencesthe cause behind the shifts in polar fields is not understood. however, it is known that the shifts coincide with the increase and decrease in the number of sunspots over an about 11-year cycle.marcus: cold. because it is all swirling and swirling like this. (shows me the swirling sky with his hands.)it was a traumatic event but i was able to move on with little to none complications && now at the age of 21 i have been diagnosed with hypertension high blood pressure just this passed weekend.i\\'m really thankful for the weasley china cabinet (don\\'t you like how it\\'s earned an official name?). it provides some much needed storage for the living room, which freed up storage in the kitchen. i also made use of our non-working retro radio console by storing all my candles in the top.one by one the floors are emptied. . . the uniformedheat olive oil over medium heat until it thins and shimmers (about 6 seconds). lower each blossom flat into the hot oil, taking care not to crowd them in skillet. each subsequent blossom will lower the temperature of the oil, so care must be taken to adjust heat level. it must maintain an even, but not violent sizzle. do not overly heat the oil to speed the process. burning the blossoms can occur very quickly. fry on each side for about 5 minutes until golden brown, using long metal tongs to turn them. remove to fresh paper towels to drain. scatter with sea salt and ground pepper. serve immediately.as our religious freedoms come under political attack, it is clear that decades of “reprogramming” has been successfully accomplished right under our heaven-pointed noses. we’ve been silent in the face of violence. we’ve been silent in the face of compromise. we’ve been silent in the face of the slaughter of millions of unborn babies. we’ve been silent too long, my friends. why? because we were told our religion was meant to stay within the walls of our local assemblies – within the building. now, the salt as lost is savor. there is little difference between those of us who call ourselves believers and those who do not.this post by calculated risk was a shock to us on the demographics behind student loans. during the housing bubble you had an asset, but these loans have no real collateral (paper diploma) that make this a very concerning issue.we all quickly got up from my front stoop and ran into the street. our eyes were all fixed on a late model olive colored pontiac, it looked like a 68 or 69 gto. as it raced down east 4th and approached beverley we prepared ourselves for that horrible sound.ok, i did warn you there might be rather a lot about dickens this year! this is pip (philip pirrip) in his latest incarnation, douglas booth, in the recent bbc adaptation of great expectations. too pretty, do i hear you say? a lot of people thought so, by which i mean people of my acquaintance, both in reality and in those parallel versions of it on facebook and twitter.but within the life cyclei knew he was just scared. my leaving was breaking his heart. i’m pretty sure if i looked closer, i’d see tears in his eyes. god, i felt so heartless, so cruel, but…i knew betty was right. this was something that had to be done.one reason is that it has been replaced with “climate change” and the other reason is that the only people talking about climate change seem to be leaders of governments like the united states or australia.a different love than minenow i don’t want to be disingenuous. i recognize that everyone has mental associations that can be immediate or creeping, positive or negative, conscious or subconscious, and it’s not unexpected for people to think that the article is about black kids when they hear the term “bucket boys” or see the picture included in the article. that’s fair. so i’m going to cop to a few things that honest self-awareness compels me to note, but maybe not what you’d expect.one of the powerful things about article marketing, especially if you are building a list, is that subscribers who come to you after reading one of your articles tend to buy more than subscribers who come to you from many other traffic sources. generally, when someone subscribes to your list after reading one or several of your articles, they already are beginning to trust you, and might buy from you sooner than someone who needs to read several emails from you and perhaps communicate online before they will purchase. article writing simply provides a unique opportunity for you too attract subscribers to your list who have a prequalified interest and trust in you.with that being said, my counters do resemble butcher block just not 100% and the cost was only $56 for the whole project. i did my counters all by myself and took one whole weekend to complete so ladies don\\'t think that this project is too difficult to take on. if you can work a jig saw than go for it.2. place the styrofoam in the container, then insert the lollipop sticks into the foam, leaving a few inches in between the sticks to make room for the cones. (you can insert the sticks in neat rows or in a random configuration – whichever you prefer!)i’m sorry to say that my second encounter with ms. morton left me more than a little disappointed. in fact, though the distant hours seemed like it would have many of the same characteristics as morton’s earlier work, they were almost entirely absent from this book. the distant hours felt under-crafted and under-thought, with paper-thin characters and a heavy-handed delivery. it’s all the more surprising because i described the forgotten garden as finely crafted, with a light touch of symbolism. the distant hours is the opposite. edie is a clunky narrator with no apparent personality and her voice often drew me out of the narrative with references to “what she’d learn later” or things she “wished she could have known then.” she has no personality of her own and her mother’s connection to the castle is never properly exploited.yesterday was mother\\'s day and for me was a very difficult day.i\\'m working on putting together out-of-town baskets for our guests. i\\'m re-using old galvanized pails that we had around the house as the baskets and am planning on stuffing them with local spring water, organic juices as well as regional maps, information and locally-made treats.it was a ready to make package.he holds many classified info involving the cm activities in these portfolios and vice versa and they thereby mutually protect one another.2. neu! - isiang says one of the most important recipes for success is having the ability to adapt to changes around you.this was a moment of disappointment, and hurt, and anger, and feeling cheated, all over again. what the hell was i thinking? his statement-validity hardly lasts too long, and i\\'m running into what i already know was a wall, except that this time i was hoping it was a styrofoam wall this time. so what? if we actually did get back together and he proposed because he thought he was ready, he might actually change his mind months into the proposal? this was scary shit.that one could sigh alonei was in agony for the next while, checking my phone every free chance i got, then finallyi absolutely love doing all of these things, but it hasn\\'t left as much time to post and visit my blogs.i\\'d honestly really like to live in holywood. its such a nice area, definitely something to look into for the future.this recycled sailcloth collection of bags, shower curtains and dog beds is a must have for all those who are nautical-minded! the bags are durable and affordable and come in a wide range of sizes! available from ella vickers.update: 25th february, 2011. although the mainstream media is not yet reporting on outcome of the hearing today it seems that there is a motions hearing scheduled for next friday 4th march 2011 at the supreme court before mr. justice hardiman, mr. justice finnegan and mr. justice o’donnell at 11am which suggests that mcinerney is appealing and is probably seeking a motions hearing to continue its examinership protection pending the appeal. more later…i\\'ve been having all these signs that my body is working at getting him out of there (warning tmi): losing my mucus plug, menstrual style cramping, dried blood in my ever increasing amount of discharge, i haven\\'t had a solid bowel movement in weeks, the kid has dropped...a lot. but my cervix is apparently still behind my son\\'s head, it\\'s not really effaced at all and it\\'s only dilated to about 1.5 cm. i feel like a failure that my body seems to be working so hard and nothing, almost nothing is happening. it\\'s not just that i\\'m jealous that they all have their babies right now (obviously that\\'s part of it), but their bodies did things right and mine seems like it doesn\\'t know what to do and i\\'m left mad and frustrated...and hugely, uncomfortably pregnant without any sign of relief. i know...i won\\'t be pregnant forever, but i had this idea that i was going to be able to do this thing naturally. that i wouldn\\'t have to force my body to get this kid out, that it was going to be wonderful, beautiful experience. now it\\'s probably going to end up with me being induced with either my kid being so drugged upon his arrival or me being drugged from a c-section that i won\\'t be able to appreciate it like i expected to. and of course, having to wait to do any of this for another 2 wks because my ob/gyn clinic won\\'t induce me until 41 wks.nipping a potential antm cycle ain’t easy. really.i collected knowledge very slowly. fortunately (and i suppose inevitably) as i continued my relationship with boats information came in as relentlessly as the tide. so as a result my pool of knowledge very gradually became deeper. unfortunately, also in keeping with my metaphor of the tide, my knowledge seemed to go out too. knowledge i was so happy to finally possess would recede and be gone several hours later. i am not altogether certain this phenomenon was due to natural causes or if it was exacerbated by frequent infusions of myers’ rum and light beer but i guess those are a couple of the reasons it has taken such a long time to assemble the permanent stockpile of knowledge i now supposedly posses. of course now i am so old i have difficulty remembering the knowledge anyway.i took them to lunch at firehouse subs so she could claim her free birthday sub (it\\'s a huge medium sub!) - which i ate and thoroughly enjoyed! bought 2 kids meals (turkey subs) for them :) callie ate the whole thing and caleb ate almost his whole sandwich. i remember the days when the kids would just eat a few bites off mine, or they could share one kids meal. those days are long gone!*the games are free to play.no reason that would dopaint wooden ornamentsimmediately pour it over the egg mixture, bit by bit, whisking well continuously.if i did, maybe my kids would be asking me to stay off facebook, too.she, spiritually, into my roomsuccessfully used over the past few years they are now creating the possibility of having allprisma red shallot (july-august?)by liat collinshis eyes went wide again and then i shot him in the chest. he gasped and moved his mouth as if to speak. in my head he was saying “ouch charlie that hurt”. i laughed and shot him again in the head. i put my gun away and walked out the door. his office is in his house and he lives alone, so no one was coming. he had crazies in and out of there every day and he didn’t even have video cameras. idiot.the colour package is not so much a package, but instead refers to books with any internal colour inserts and those books are subject to specific cost quotes depending on what the author requires.ch: this demands a lot of things! you know it, because you are a teacher as well, that currently the available tango pedagogy is much more decoded than ten years ago and so it is easier to learn. today you do a volcada and a colgada and it is the same because they are there, commercially speaking, in the same package. then, between doing a sandwichito or a volcada, people do a volcada, because it\\'s more eye-catching. in tango people are self-centered; there is much individuality. they are not going to make a sandwichito to enjoy that moment, but whatever shows them more and better. in the musical field astor piazzolla broke with everything but you listen to it and it is tango. and today in the dance many think that they are piazzolla and they aren\\'t. i see men and women that only worry about how they are seen from the outside. it is a pretty complicated situation because it has to do with a very porteño personality and identity.i confess i have never understood why anyone would give up meat, pork, fish or any other animal worth eating to pursue a vegan lifestyle. a lot of people, however, must be doing this because there are three vegan cookbooks on my desk. chloe’s kitchen: 125 easy, delicious recipes for making the food you love the vegan way by chloe coscarelli ($18.99, free press, softcover) lives up to its title by this tv personality. the book’s foreword by dr. neal d. barnard explains how a vegan diet can help you lose weight, reduce cholesterol, and deal with diseases. the author demonstrates that vegan cooking need not be bland, visually unappetizing and mostly just sprouts. fact is, the photos will make your mouth water. da capo press is a major publisher of books about the vegan lifestyle and two of its latest titles are gluten-free vegan comfort food by susan o’brien ($18.00, softcover) and let them eat vegan!

here they are, jambu odyssey:her legs are my favorite part, they will be just perfect for chubby little baby hands to grab hold of and pull around the house.layer 3: cookie again, with a hole (or two!) to see the jam. and, as the french say cerise sur le gâteau, a paper-thin layer of royal icing.he helped me up and held me and again we were just quiet together. i cried silent tears into his neck. i yawned and then couldn\\'t stop yawning. he patted me twice and i got up. he brought me to bed undressed me and told me to lay down. i laid on my belly and he didn\\'t cover me. he kissed me pointed the fan on me and went to get ready for bed. when he came back i was already dozing. he laid down and pulled me to him. he whispered to me for a bit. my eyes were so heavy with sleep that i could only mumble a sound here and there when i thought it appropriate. he kissed my eyes. he told me everything was right again. he told me he was going to sleep well because i was back in his arms. he dragged his fingers softly up and down my back. i sighed. he pressed his lips against my forehead and prepared for sleep. i could feel the warm breath coming from his nostrils. then ever so softly he whispered the most beautiful words against my skin.one of the \"boys of summer\"enough preaching about crossfit....i shared this because while working out i have also started to adopt the eating habits that are prevalent among crossfitters...which is a combination of the \\'paleo diet\\' (basically lots of fruit and veggies, gluten free and good proteins) and a zone diet (again, lost of fruits and veggies, limited grains, if any, and quality lean protein). being food-obsessed this was a bit tough for me at first, i have no gluten sensitivity and frankly love to try new things so the thought of limiting myself to these confines really bothered me at first. slowly though i have adapted, partly because our crossfit gym (much love to milestone crossfit!!) set up a 6-week challenge which i eagerly joined and partly because i have seen what the combo of this diet and crossfit does for people. in four weeks my \\'cravings\\' for grains and super-sweet candy, etc. have dwindled (not going to lie here, i would still kill for hot-buttered fresh baked french bread!) and i feel great. so again, why am i sharing all this? because it will color a lot of what i will be posting in the near term, most of my coming posts will be recipes that have been made since the beginning of my 6-week challenge and will be reflective of ingredients that are \\'zone-paleo\\' friendly. so be wary those of you who aren\\'t so excited about \\'healthy\\' food, these things will all be slightly better for you than most that i have posted in the past but none of them will taste like \\'health\\' food, i refuse to give up good food for just healthy food.i shared this earlier today at my grandmother’s funeral service:*disclaimer: research and information for this post was done online. consuming large quantities or unripened persimmons can cause some medical issues. if you have medical questions you should consult a professional in the medical field.for a person who prefers her social calendar being empty rather than make plans in advance i actually have the next few weekends booked out as much as i’ll let them get. if i think about this it makes me exceptionally anxious and gives me the urge to change my number and lock myself in the house.guest curator yukio lippit, professor of japanese art, harvard university, describes the lush, stylized set as one of the great stand-outs in the history of japanese art. if you\\'re unable to visit the nga, a new 240-page, well-illustrated catalogue with specific entries (in english) on each of the 30 scrolls -- along with the latest conservation findings -- will be available, too.it was after that concert that he proposed. the happiness i felt then was overwhelming and, looking back on the scene, i was still amazed at how that grew beyond what i thought possible. the screen skipped to our first kiss as husband and wife, i remembered the love, finally enjoying the tranquility i thought i could have. on the screen, everything faded.we\\'re thinking about adding loads of shelving in here at some point, so getting rid of the window made sense. i convinced adam to leave the ceiling unfinished and just paint it (we got rid of that fiberglass insulation though). i figure drywall is really heavy, i\\'m short and it\\'s a storage room. in other words, the cost-benefit ratio isn\\'t good. painting the ceiling the same colour as the walls will help it blend in and adding some simple trim along the tops of the walls will help it look more \\'finished\\' (we\\'re thinking thin pine strips painted the same colour as the walls/ceiling). this beautiful artist\\'s rendering of said trim gives you an idea of what i\\'m talking about:a team of scientists at harvard medical school in boston studied 4,000 obese adults and found those who followed the common sense advice were much more likely to lose weight than those who adopted fad slimming regimes, went on liquid diets or bought weight-loss supplements.his humility and \"his decency\" are two things, so they \"reflect,\" not \"reflects.\"- we must take 100% responsibility for our lives. anything short of that won’t get us what we really want.i would love to offer up something amazingly poignant today but i simply don’t have it in me after the philadelphia flyers came back from an early 3-0 deficit to beat the pittsburgh penguins 4-3 in overtime.this is a typical example of relatively accurate information delivered with an “attitude” to imply a coming catastrophe. look at the temperature chart above. the global temps did indeed rise several tenths of a degree before 1940 which shows why measurement over a century would show a sea level rise. then for 35 years the globe cooled during the massive co2 output of the post war industrial boom. then global temps rose quickly from 1976 to 1998 which would result in a rapid warming and expansion of the ocean just nasa says which makes sense given the date of their data set, but since most of this happened before the post war industrial boom how is this mans fault?sexual propaganda for fuddy duddies?

would argue anyone’s life) that can’t be summed up by my selfishness. selfishness looks out for one thing and one thing only: my own interest. selfishness makes a person ugly and unappealing inside and out. selfishness leaves a person empty, alone and hopeless, yet in the midst of it, selfishness promises instant gratification previously unknown.in heaven, our bodies will be different from what they area couple of years ago, as i was checking out at one of my favorite thrift stores, there was a box filled with music cd\\'s. there are no sleeve covering, so i guess that is why they were

telling them the insurance cheque would arrive shortly and then they’d get paid. a few, but not many, put me on hold or cod and that made it all the more difficult to service what little business we did have. i called the life insurance company late in january asking when the cheque would be coming and they told me they were waiting for the police report to arrive before releasing payment.new beginnings reportedly couldn\\'t and didn\\'t perfom the court functions being privatized, instead constructing what seems from a distance almost a surreal potemkin village where company officials

young father helped us load in our suitcases, redeeming the entire male population of france. we settled into our assigned seats, a grouping of four. there was only one person opposite us, a large, scowling, gypsy of a woman, who grunted and buried her head in a paperback as we settled in. the club car was right behind us and we could hear the merry voices of the young vacationers. i pulled out my travel bible. i had promised my aunt i would give her some guidance as to how to navigate the sometimes daunting book before we got to taize. although she’d been baptized and confirmed, run a pre-school program at an episcopal church, and maintained a childlike faith her whole life, she had never read the bible or done any sort of bible study. this was not uncommon for women of her generation, who were merely asked to make sure the family was dressed nicely for church and didn’t do anything scandalous.when the astros (or whatever their name will be that season) move to the al

new lil wayne track right here…..the physical side of a relationship includes attraction and sexual satisfaction. this category is self explanatory. are you attracted to your partner? does your partner satisfy you in the bedroom? overall, this tends to be the least important category in a relationship. some people tend to over look this category if the other two categories are being fulfilled. it really all depends on the person, the goal is to find out what your needs are. if you have to be attracted or sex is important to you, this category will probably be at the top of your list. but be careful, many people fall in love with the physical and realize, when it’s too late, that the other two sides of the relationship aren’t being met. the physical side of the relationship tends to be the “trouble seeker” in relationships for that reason. over the years, i’ve come to realize that people tend to confuse love and lust. so just make sure you aren’t in lust with your partner but in love with them.for starters, let’s dispel this nonsense that states that zombies, in their science fiction capacity, are ‘the living dead’. no, they aren’t. they aren’t dead at all–they’re alive. they are people with a disease that modifies their behavior, and that’s it. they can’t be dead because dead things don’t (and can’t) move around. no disease imparts motility on inanimate matter. no disease can. the disease’s function is to attack the brain, primarily, for the purpose of altering behavior in a specific way (see part 2). viruses don’t have muscles to move things, even collectively, and even if they did there is very little likelihood they could coordinate together on such a massive scale as to operate a human body in even a rudimentary fashion. hell, they don’t have *eyes*. good luck spreading a zombie plague without eyes, super-virus. sorry, but zombies are living people.step 16: application of vitamin e and water-based moisturizer on the

appreciatea part of me died along with jill - the part that never knew about suffering and death; the part that believed in miracles; the part that believed things happened for a reason. it\\'s a loss of innocence, i guess, and it\\'s something i\\'ll never get back. i can\\'t \"unsee\" the things i saw, or \"unlearn\" the things i learned, so i\\'ve had to find new ways of looking at things. i\\'m finding my way, but i\\'ll never be the same. there will always be a hole in my life that can never be filled, a best friend lost forever. a lifelong friendship like we had is something that few people ever experience, and although i will live the rest of my life without her, i will treasure every single moment that we shared while she was here. and as hard as it was for me to watch her suffer like that, i\\'m glad i was there, and i hope that in some small way my being there helped make it a little less horrible and painful for her. i\\'ll never forget the way jill died, but neither will i forget the way she lived. her life was tragically short, but she got more joy out of her brief time here than most people ever do. jill lived every day of her life as a shining example of how to be at peace with the world and everything in it. she was the most positive and happy and optimistic person i\\'ve ever known, and you can\\'t be around someone like that without learning from them. she made a difference in the lives of everyone who knew her, and every single life she touched has been forever changed. i truly believe she was an angel who came into my life for a reason. i just

valentine\\'s day, and i loaded my car, very excited to make the presentation of what would assuredly come as an unexpected gift. i had not yet, however, made a decision whether to supplement the tv with flowers. i realized that my options were now very limited, and barring a purchase of inexpensive flowers from a green grocer, it was too late, particularly in manhattan, to buy quality roses from a flower shop. from my story that morning:what i had of this story at this point was all mashed around in a google doc. now, i love google docs – i like sharing documents with other people who can read them and comment on them or edit them along side of me. but it lacked the organizational extras of scrivener. so i gave in, downloaded the free version of celtx and started transferring stuff

about the budget. he had to walk that back real quick. rantin\\' said that what he really meant was that obama had announced that there was going to be $500 billion in cuts over 10 years - it was actually $487 billion, but close enough - and that the pentagon had to form the strategy meet that figure. he said it should have been the other way around. that is, the pentagon, unlike any other agency of the federal government, should have been able to say \"this is what we want and you are going to have to come up with however much money it\\'s going to take to do that.\"when it comes to making sure the “job creators” don’t pay their fair share of taxes, or attacking regulations to protect citizens from abuse by greedy corporations, the golden rule found in luke’s gospel, “do to

every time i turn on the news, read a newspaper, or just hear any american politician speak, i am left with the same question that made me start this blog to begin with \"seriously? why?\"this post goes straight to my positivism about za as i recall it, especially as a result of the leadership of mandela. all of us in sa were influenced by his leadership and vision. of course it rubbed off, and of course we were all ready to do our bit. and of course i still have bit of that old “madiba magic” in me today, as jaded as it may be…this blog is meant to be about writing, and i commit to 95% of

possibly do anything to decrease the millions of orphaned children around the world. if you wonder how god could call you to rescue and give a home and be a family to the least of these. if you wonder where the money, time, and energy will come from. i ask you to remember that with our god all things are truly possible. god did not leave us as orphans. he rescued us! adoption matters to our lord.

theory: the repetitions aren’t signs of senility and age, but of perpetual youth and vitality. we wouldn’t be surprised to see this in a man so delighted with the prospect of eternal life. g. k. chesterton once wrote that children, precisely because of their vitality, always say “’do it again’; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead.”[4] john loves repetition the way

always female, but when did i make the transition from girl to woman? when do any of us? is it an age thing? does it happen with life’s milestones like graduation/marriage/motherhood? does it happen

properties, the denial of our animal nature can have serious costs for health and well-being. reminders of mortality have been shown, for example, to decrease women\\'s intentions to conduct breast self-examinations, and might also fuel body objectification, which is known to damage mental health. not only can this denial hurt our health, but it may undermine our very humanity and sense of aliveness. as becker put it, \"the irony of man\\'s condition is that the deepest need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation; but it is life itself which awakens it, and so we must

another way messenger angels relay messages to humans on earth. in fact, omens may very well be the most common way of doing so. if you think about the biblical scripture you will remember that in the very first book of genesis it says that “there shall be signs in the sun, moon, and stars.” omens are signs; omens are portents. since these scriptures date back thousands of years it is fair to say that signs have become a familiar thing, especially among the ancient peoples. they looked to signs to predict the weather, to predict the success of crops, to predict famine, war, and other monumental human events. people have long paid attention to signs and omens. when a sign appears in the heavens it does not appear to one race or nation, but is seen by the eyes of people worldwide.the actual united states wealth distribution plotted against the estimated and ideal distributions across all respondents. because of their small percentage share of total wealth, both the

monday morning being about $500 short. i did not know what to do. i remember just sitting in my bed thinking about what to do, what to say, and who to talk to, i continued to repeat, “i don’t know what to do. i don’t know what to do.” i truly did not know what to do. i did not want to call the missions organization and say i could not go, but at the same time i did not have the money to afford

effort from portal, lost in the translation and i was pleasantly surprised to hear from folks how much they liked it or were looking for it for years, lost their copy or whatever. so without further delay i happy to finally share the debut release from portal. for those who missed that first post, portal was a experimental home recording project by contra/church of the rowdy guitarist stephe cooper. in these home experiments cooper employed various genres-prog rock, art rock, kraut rock, midi/electronic music, ambient and even lo fi garage punk. i think lost in the translation is a much more calculated, though out work thus to my ears being a bit more enjoyable than the debut, however this disc is certainly enjoyable and firmly lays the groundwork of what was to come. honestly, it is a shame that cooper only released two portal cds because both are so damn good. this debut cd-r features a jane\\'s addiction cover.i have known since learning from my pleiadian entourage back in my

atlanta after my first early-90s sojourn to new york, this statement rang in my head for years. i had always hoped to return to new york, but atlanta had clawed me in its grips, as hometowns often do. yeah, my life was there, but my heart was way up north. and now, here i was, with steve driving a car speeding its way to the home of the man who made this statement that had stuck with me so. on the way up, i bought a copy of levon\\'s memoir (co-written by stephen davis) called this wheel\\'s on fire: levon helm and the story of the band. steve and i stopped at two hotel rooms (one in north carolina and one in new jersey), and i read as much of the book as i could. i had never really known about the rancor within the band, but levon\\'s book clued me in on why robbie robertson was the sole songwriter credited for all their songs: it was a lawyerin\\' thing.in honor of the upcoming olympics, time warner is offering “national anthem karaoke” on its sports & fitness on demand channel. i know, really silly. when i saw it i thought it might be a joke because who would actually click on that?it also made me realize that this is a lifetime thing. i can never completely relax about the food or the exercise. i need both even at target weight, thanks to lower metabolism. it also led me to change to a more body building approach from the get-go even though it is a little counteractive to a pure weight loss program. i want more muscle because it will help kick up the metabolism (even if it only turns out to be small% gain – i need every % i can get). weight training also helps fight osteoporosis. plus the endorphins from exercise help mood and energy. so does looking ripped.another part of the article i object to is the idea that kids make marriages worse. in essence, it says that kids place quite a strain on a marriage, although it only discusses one type of family--one where both the mother and father work outside of the home, and wait until their mid thirties to have their first kid (and possibly last kid). i have only had a kid for a few months, but it is a bit of a shock in the personal freedom department, and i am still learning how to balance my needs and wants with luthien\\'s. it\\'s been hard figuring out how to be married and how to raise a baby at the same time. i don\\'t see the logic in the article on this point though. facing and overcoming challenges in a marriage should serve to strengthen it, not weaken it. but this article seems to say that once a couple has children their relationship is only about the kids. i have seen this first hand, but i have also seen marriages that are still awesome and fully functioning with several children. i think couples have to be careful not to let their marriage slide after having kids, rather they need to use the challenges to strengthen and grow their marriage. it reminds me how important it is to make my marriage a priority. i think that because andy and i will have dealt with this balance between marriage and children from the beginning we will be able to learn the necessary skills to keep both healthy. this isn\\'t to say that couples who have children later can\\'t do this, just that for us it is good to do it early on.their cover page has a qr code on it. i can snap a picture on whatever device i need and have their summary post up on my screen in less than a second.

in the government, so that it does not trigger resignation or dissolution. but then, we need a mechanism other than an election for getting over the conflict between the two chambers, at least for those bills that need to be passed, such as budgets. how this is to be done is not obvious (though not impossible), but whatever mechanism is, its existence dilutes the power of the second chamber to reject the government’s proposals and thus diminishes the benefits waldron hopes for it.my religion compels me, and i love it for it, to be against discrimination of any kind in our country. and i

interpretation), the universe is essential eternal (so creation is not linear but circular), so, other principles such as rebirth of souls (reincarnation), and a guiding code such as karma must be in place (this to provide for inevitable progression or digression of the succession of a person’s existence until they become one with a transpersonal god as the ideal reality).larry passes his class.

seems to get more attention from the men at the factory, although she’s glad that vittorio is not one of them. brenda, although she’s escaped her marriage, is still repressed by it, and in a way has replaced stanley with freda. brenda isn’t good at making her feelings known, and can usually be talked, henpecked into anything, never wanting to upset the status quo.3) figure out my living

animals.i need to tell you something.all of these things will soon be a distant memory for me. i’m so glad i have the photos to help remind me of the smell and feel and sounds and tastes of se asia

memories of standing outside mamaw’s house, in front of whatever shrub was in full bloom, dressed in my best suit and tight, shiny black shoes, getting my picture made with mean sisters, bossy cousins, and everyone else in the family. so many pictures i couldn’t see after the flashes were finished. but glad to be finished with the pretty part of easter, we were able to tear off our ties, change our shoes, shed coats and sometimes shirts, and get busy hiding and finding eggs all over the yard, stopping only long enough to eat jelly beans and chocolate bunny ears. wearing black beads and needing naps, we made the long journey home complete with baskets of cracked, colored eggs we would keep for weeks in our treasure troves. just a word of advice, don’t eat those things after the third day. take my word on that.we were met just inside the door by an agent who verified all the needed paperwork before assigning us to the next line. the time was slow, so another agent was available and we went up to the desk.christopher reeve is back in the title role, but he is about it. gone are gene hackma and margot kidder (save for a cameo) , as are just about every element which made the previous films great. robert vaughn takes the role of the non-descript megolmaniacal villain. ross webster. go ahead. describe everything you remember about him. but the worst element is, of course, richard pryor. superman was a big property for warner brothers at the time and pryor was box office gold. but only in a studio executive’s mind could those things go together and make something good.the lack of focus on training and fundraising tends to bring more things to the surface. the fact that i’ve had a rough time finding a job when i finish my fellowship. that our sweet kitty passed. that we almost had to move out when our landlord decided to raise the rent. that we don’t really know where we’ll be in the next few months. it’s been quite a year, so much that i can definitely say my best day was running a marathon in 89 degrees.ink: memento black, versamark, pink pirouetteorganized religion is what i find hard to swallow. i believe that it\\'s often used as a tool to control the masses through fear and hate. do as i (your religious leader) tell you or you will burn in hell. hate these people for they are different (don\\'t agree with me/ have land or

mark steyn, among others. the usa and the uk, the major powers of the previous 3 centuries, will be at the centre of this one, too. but they will share the spot with india and maybe some other

implies that it is ruined. or that, even if it can be put back together, it will never look presentable. like if you break a ceramic plate into a million little pieces and you glue every single one back together, no one would want to hang that plate on the wall. but did you know that when you put a piece of ceramic stone in the kiln, the heat automatically creates millions of litte cracks…that were meant to be there? so the stone ends up being cracked…but in a beautiful way. people end up paying thousands of dollars for what appears to be a cracked piece of stone. so maybe we’re just not broken, but just beautifully cracked. and that’s the way it was meant to be.”run by a very friendly lady boss, this stall serves nothing but oyster cakes, and from the looks of it, they are selling a

shaariibuu, with which prime minister najib razak is said to be entangled. the trial started in january 2007, but the appeal has not even heard in the court of appeal five years later, and looks set

tarn and carrie. there is a very nice sequence in the second hundred pages, for instance, where they have to shapeshift into the form of evil creatures to evade their pursuers, but then tarn starts to lose himself in the role. but the sequences from the point of view of puretongue and various side characters -- there are a surprising number of pov shifts in the second hundred pages -- are less compelling to me. in those other sequences, i was always anxious to get back to tarn and carrie.- price point (things to consider: conference fee, transportation, hotel accommodations, etc.)what about

luke says, “repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at jerusalem” (lk 24.47); and as it reads in the acts of the apostles: “you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem, and in judea and samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (acts 1.8). the orthodox church of christ (sometimes called “eastern orthodox” or “greek orthodox”) is the native church of the holy land, and has owned and operated the most holy sites in christendom for the past two millennia. the families that are the descendants of those first disciples of jesus have lived continuously in the holy land as devout orthodox faithful for the past 2000 years, for the church of jerusalem following the great schism of 1054, would remain part of the orthodox church, not the roman catholic church, although rome would later establish a presence there.events: semi-annual beer brunch with hoosier beer geekdecision #4: writing a pointless blog post before cleaning my house. at least i\\'m

(that, and the giant hand protruding from the front of the building…holding, what else? a beer.) johnny southside and i took a couple of seats on the patio where we could watch the a-10 warthogs coming in on approach just across the railroad tracks. we ordered up a dose of onion rings from a scruffy-faced bartender and i had a pint of porter that didn’t appear to be on the printed menu. (nimbus offers six beers packaged in bottles for sale but there are more beers available at the brewery.) the porter looked, smelled and tasted just like a porter should in my book; faintly sweet tasting with a hint of chocolate. i’d give it high marks and only regret that it isn’t one of the beers they offer for sale in bottles. i bought a t-shirt as a souvenir of the visit and in short order

preparing the vegetable even exists in the earliest surviving cookbook from the 3rd century ad. picked before the shoots ripen (they get harder and less edible when ripe), asparagus can be eaten as the white or green varieties (white asparagus, which is milder in flavor, has been grown without much exposure to the sun) and cooked fresh or pickled to stay for months. they’re a very healthy vegetable, providing tons of fiber, potassium, and vitamin c, and is used as a diuretic. an early bird in the vegetable family, the harvesting season for asparagus starts in late april and runs through june–meaning that may is the perfect time to get fresh, delicious asparagus straight from the farmer’s market. slap on a little hollandaise sauce and those shoots are ready to go!a new forever

her credit for having the guts to create a book that paints slavery in harsh terms, with stories about separated families and mothers who committed suicide after having their child seized from them and sold away. all this written by a woman, in a time when women couldn’t vote and it was unseemly for a lady to have an opinion about anything but fashion and raising a family.“district 751 has

doing so, riggs feels we might better be able to re-acquire the mysterious abilities we once possibly possessed, and that the more primitive peoples still seem to retain.written by sally wainwright, who has a real ear for genuine-sounding dialogue and an eye for the details in life, it’s also quietly political. instead of reporting to a patriarchal figure, the boss in scott & bailey is female – di gill murphy (amelia bullmore). unlike jane tennison in prime supect, she doesn’t blaze any trails: she just is. as russell t davies, the acclaimed screenwriter who cast sharp in bob & rose, the second coming and doctor who, observed: “even now, scott & bailey is remarkable just for being a cop show led by three women. the sheer existence of that show shames the rest of us.”there, you said

want to prep your meat. for the white meat chicken: i took one large chicken breast, trimmed it (i’m picky about chicken in that i don’t like “googlies.” one of the billion advantages of cooking at home — you know every single thing that’s going into your food!). then, i sliced the breast into half-inch medallion-like pieces. i rubbed each piece with some veggie oil, placed it on a sheet of saran wrap, covered with another sheet of saran wrap, and pounded each piece to half its original thickness. this is definitely not necessary, but i love thin pieces of chicken best (mostly because they have more surface area which means more places for sauce to stick). makes them extra tender too. totally fine to skip the pounding though. i threaded the chicken pieces onto wooden skewers that i had soaked in water for a bit so they don’t catch fire on the grill.my god has called me to go to india.of course, guests were ecstatic at the fresh new recipes, flavors and all good things that i now

amaretto on the rocks, i decided the sprained neck story was too good to withhold. the best part? it was so terribly awkward and ridiculous that my best friend, who went to film school, decided to

soft and creamy. add the sugar and beat for another 3 minutes. add the eggs one by one, and then the yolk, beating for 1 minute after each addition. beat in the vanilla; don\\'t be concerned if the mixture looks curdled. reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk, adding the dry ingredients in 3 additions and the milk in 2 (begin and end with the

legend about the creation of the valley in which the ancient city of kathmandu stands. in that legend, one of a number that can be traced back to the 4th or 5th century ad, chhepu lived first in the muddy bottom of the lake which filled the valley. and then, when the lake had emptied through a gap made in the surrounding hills by an inquisitive giant, deep under the valley’s floor.the best part

610 n. buchanan blvd tempers became frayed and some sharp words were exchanged and one of the boys, again not one of those who later faced charges, made the mistake of using the infamous “n” word, although, he did not do so until after the second dancer had accused the players of being “skinny dicked white boys”. another player made a somewhat obscure comment asking the women to thank their grandparents for his “fine cotton shirt” which the media later determined to be a reference to slavery and therefore condemned the team to lasting allegations of racism.raymond and beverly sackleri am

curious about us. he went on to reveal how one of the people they had been studying had suddenly died. they had never seen something die before, unlike us their bodies continually rejuvenate their cells, diseases, aging, death were as alien to them as the images he passed through my mind were to me. he went on to explain how they had been resurrecting our dead in hopes of understanding what it truly meant to die. none of them realized that the radiation they were exposing the corpses to during their revitalization process would have the effect it did on our bio-chemistry. he tried to explain in terms i could grasp that they had been using a medical device designed to speed up cellular growth and heal injuries to revitalize our dead. the radiation he explained, acted like a charger energizing a dead battery as it were. our cells however were too fragile to handle the process, and as the bodies continued to break down it released the radiation. when the radiation came into contact with our living matter it overloaded our cells destroying them while simultaneously trying to restore them in effect locking the person exposed in a perpetual death state.uptown opens with another (yawn) jazz ode to manhattan which is made more curious by the fact that david basse is the acknowledged “leader” of the kansas city jazz scene. in fact, two of the first three tracks are new

attitude. for the stoic, the ideal attitude was to be calm and free of passion. if one was able to attain this virtue, then one could be happy, regardless of what happened in life, making you immune to misfortune.… the most worthy calling in life is that in which man can serve best his fellow man. … the noblest aim in life is to strive to live to make other lives better and happier. ― david o. mckayif you have never read a book on marriage before, macdonald’s magnificent marriage can get you on the right track. there’s nothing necessarily wrong with the book, but in comparison to what is available in marriage books, there’s little good about it either. instead of macdonald’s book, go and find a copy of one (or both) of the following two books: first, john gottman’s the seven principles for making marriage work, which is the most practically useful book on marriage i’ve ever read. the other book is mike mason’s the mystery of marriage, which is the most theologically stirring and poetic meditation on marriage i’ve read.my eyes welled up i tried to fight the lump in my throat and fight off the tears but i could do it no longer. a few short minutes later a dss worker walked into the room said her father (angelo) was here and it was now tike for me to say good bye!i love snowmobiling. flying over the snow, catching air over drifts. i love to drive, to be at the helm of the beast as i weave around trees and over hill and dale, my husband sitting behind me. i also love riding behind my husband as he drives, feeling those powerful arms as he’s muscling the snowmobile into the wilds. we follow unknown trails, driven by a magellan spirit, hoping that we have enough gas to get us back to civilization. i love hanging on, simply trusting him, knowing that wherever he’s taking me, he’s going first.there’s a very particular structure to comics stories where superheroes meet for the first time, and the avengers adheres to this with admirable fidelity, for the most part. first of all you get the sequences introducing everyone individually and demonstrating what their schtick is, and these are present (mostly). then, before battle is joined with the actual villain, there is the inevitable misunderstanding and/or clash of egos resulting in the good guys knocking seven bells out of each other at great length. this sort of thing fuels the perpetual ‘who would win in a fight between…’ debates comic fans love, and the avengers goes for this with great enthusiasm. the initial barney between thor and iron man is jolly enough, but i was particularly delighted later one when the story finds time for a proper scrap between thor and the hulk. once this is out of the way it’s time for some regrouping and laying in of plot ahead of the final battle.once in brooklyn, eilis becomes more solid. she has a sharp mind for bookkeeping and begins taking classes at brooklyn college while working full time. she handles her new life with careful

in both new mexico and the continental united states during that period. and as the fbi noted with respect to the public health service: “…they have found positive evidence of the plague among wild

of children will turn out just as well as the preceding generation, raised before there were comic books.it’s day 4 of 2012, this funny first week when we all reappear from the christmas break, still trying to remember what we did before the christmas madness hit us all and getting ready for the new year in front of us. we all have made some sort of resolutions – be it not to eat another biscuit, have another glass of wine or to finally tidy up and declutter the house. some resolutions will survive the storm of daily life, others will quietly disappear without any acknowledgement from us that they ever existed.when your camera focus on the target have you ever wondered how it works?well, someone thought it was a good idea, and that someone was independent international pictures... which just happened to specialize in every single one of adamson\\'s films... that\\'s just a coincidence though, pay it no mind. but yeah, by the opening of the seventies, adamson had made bad biker movies and bad monster movies, about in equal measure. what could he do to try and appeal to all of his films\\' fans (that is, the monster fans and the biker fans)?all joking aside, i haven\\'t been in a chocolate mood lately, so i searched for a lemon-flavored bundt. i ended up using ina garten\\'s lemon yogurt cake. it has triple-whammy lemony goodness with lemon zest and lemon oil in the cake, lemon syrup drizzled over the hot cake, and a creamy, lemon glaze to finish it off.but, in this case, as with the proposals for bureaucratic control over “high pay”, or the tories mangled proposals over child benefit it is not the truly rich who are being targeted, it is not the capitalists who make millions of pounds from their capital alone, each year, but the middle class, and the purpose of that is to cover the real attack, which is on the workers below them, who will lose out proportionately more, once again. hutton himself had to admit that the average public sector pension was modest, but that didn\\'t stop him arguing for cutting it! it didn\\'t stop him arguing that the one piece of certainty that public sector workers have – that they have some idea what their pension will be when they finish work – should be removed with the scrapping of final salary schemes.some residents don’t think it is a bad thing for a child to have an ice cream after school and if they don’t buy it

is quite an experience. for starters, there is no silverware! dishes from your meal are laid out on a round piece of very thin bread, much resembling a crepe. you are given a basket of the same bread, which you tear into small strips and use to scoop up your food. essentially, you are eating with your hands. the food at kokob was heavily aromatic and spiced to perfection. i had a combo of 3 dishes - carrots and green beans in a mild sauce, pea flour and shallots in a spicy sauce, and potatoes and beetroot in a rich sauce. the potato/beet dish was the winner, but they all held their own. so, if you ever find yourself in brussels, make your way down to kokob for a proper ethiopian feast :)s: i have a soft spot for country, but san francisco in 1971, when my book is set, was rock central—the

smell of smith and cross: strong, funky and full of promise. of course the molasses was there as well, though i am still not sure if i was smelling the actual molasses or the smith and cross. also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. the first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. you would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. after i increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. the flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. overall, not bad but not great.odin’s wife, frigga—strangely played by rene russo—has two or three lines. sif, the warrior maiden who

environment\\r\\nnotwithstanding these conceptual challenges, the water wars thesis is used by decision makers and by political leaders in order to focus attention on global resource issues – and their particular basin concerns. in the main, these serve immediate political ends. boutros-boutros ghali is on record as stating in the mid-1980s that “the next war in the middle east will be fought over water, not politics.” and in the mid-1990s ismail serageldin of theworld bank warned that “if the wars of this century were fought over oil, the wars of the next century will be fought over water – unless we change our approach to managing this precious and vital resource.” such concerns and warnings rarely attempt to interrogate the realities of conflict over rivers such as the nile, but instead feed on widely perceived notions of insecurity and vulnerability within domestic populations. these feelings are often driven by public perceptions of the challenges facing shared river basins and their societies, and the political actors are feeding on and responding to those perceptions. some of these wider perceptions will also have resulted from external factors such as the impact of drought in the horn of africa and on nile flows during the 1980s.\\r\\nno storms\\r\\ni cradled my new record between both hands. gently placed it on the turntable. dropped the needle. rushed to

stellman study was not even mentioned.\\r\\na couple of months later i began to see the effect of the shift. i first noticed it when someone said, ‘i come to the burn because it’s a place where i can count on meeting god’. my heart soared and cried all at once! they were saying that about bradford’s burn! later, another said, ‘this is going to sound weird because i haven’t spoken to any of you before, but after worshipping with you i feel like i love you all’. that one brought tears of joy to my eyes – i have had that experience myself, where the lord knits your heart together with people you barely know, but who become incredibly dear to you after simply worshipping together with them for a few hours. for me, those people have become like close family. but this was the first time i had heard someone say that of the burn in bradford!\\r\\nlet the loaf cool for a few minutes and gently unmold onto a cooling rack.\\r\\nfirst up i have the card i\\'m planning to give my pops on

significant way. it is elegant, simple and radical in its scope and implications. the proposition put forward by buddhism is that there is already in reality no separation between this \\'me\\' and the rest of the universe. our perception of duality, of \\'me\\' versus \\'you\\' or \\'it\\', is the result of millenia of conditioned habituation to the notion of a separate egoic self, and our

i worked there. looking back, i am quite ready to take the blame for that. i suspect that as a brash youth, i was unable to recognize that we were very much alike and i probably should have known just to keep my mouth shut. though much better now, that is something that i have had to work on for my entire career. bob ended up retiring from cal-fire as a b.c. and still lives in town. we had a nice

all this takes place though you have to drink this liquid laxative stuff called phosphorescent citrate of manitoba for two days. this is so they can see the forest through the trees, or at least the forest without all the bear crap laying all over the ground or however that goes. man does this stuff clean you out. much to my surprise it tasted pretty good. kind of like squirt soda, appropriately enough. you should plan on taking your pants off altogether and sitting on the toilet for that entire couple of days while this stuff does its job since as soon as it goes in, it comes right out. at velocity. and it ain\\'t over till the fat lady sings...or in this case, till the fat lady shits clear for at least an hour. and the fat lady did. the fat lady about took the shine off the enamel. all the trees in that forest blew down.that is so nice. but keep in mind it’s a gesture with a price tag.conclusion: the food here is very fresh, very tasty, well presented and i doubt you can go wrong with any of their dishes; my only complaint is their prices. my wife says her meal was worth the money and i think therein lies the issue, they have priced up all the meat dishes well, but when it came to the vegetarian dishes instead of looking at what they were giving the customer they just looked at the general prices across the menu and said “well, there’s no meat, so just knock a couple of quid off and keep them somewhat inline with the rest of the prices on the menu”. a simple fix to that of course is not to change the prices, but to just give a little more on the veggie plates where the meat would have been. there is no denying the food here is good. we’ll be back again, but with prices like these i don’t think it will be for a long time. if you’re in the area and want really good food and have money to throw around here is the place to pop into – if you just want a meal and don’t want to break the bank its probably best to pop over to the huntsman across the road. whilst the staff didn’t mind at all i would say the swan inn attracts a certain type of customer who don’t really want to be bothered by children, so i would say only take the kids if they’re older or if younger, well behaved. lastly the menu did lack options on it, it would have been really good to see a veggie burger on there because there’s no way for a veggie to have any onion rings, handcut chips or any of the niceties that come accompained with the other meals (had i been alone i would never have been able to compliment the delcious homemade coleslaw). so a homemade veggie burger option would be much welcomed. other than that i would recommend coming in when the restaurant is open as by the looks of that menu, whilst still expensively priced, there are more options for us veg-heads.google’s rivals in the field of patent and trademark publishing complained in writing about the contract. the uspto then opened the contract to bidding ‐‐ on the condition the service be

m.c. escher1989--less than jake4) digital art -digital art is a general term for a range of artistic works and practices that use digital technology as an essential part of the creative and/or presentation process. since the 1970s, various names have been used to describe the process including computer art and multimedia art, and digital art is itself placed under the larger umbrella term new media art. the impact of digital technology has transformed traditional activities such as painting, drawing and sculpture, while new forms, such as net art, digital installation art, and virtual reality, have become recognized artistic practices. more generally the term digital artist is used to describe an artist who makes use of digital technologies in the production of art. in an expanded sense, “digital art” is a term applied to contemporary art that uses the methods of mass production or digital media.“a shrewd and weirdly endearing comic voice.” —newsdayafter a week of being

define my real nationality. it is a nationality suppressed so successfully by the imperial reign of washington dc that most of my countrymen have no knowledge of it. many of my countrymen use the term southerner or southron instead, and of course there is nothing wrong with that, but in designating a term that is directional in nature, the next question that begs to be asked is southern to what?\" thus we enter into the hyphenated identity of southern-american or american-southron. again, nothing wrong with that, but i do see a slight problem. by using this terminology, the connection to the united states of america is implied, and thus my countryman identifies himself as an american primarily. if that is what one wants, then fine, but i am not an american by choice. i am an american by circumstance because my people were conquered by washington dc about 150 years ago. therefore i am a dixiean. that is my real nationality. i insist. i look forward to the day when all my fellow countrymen will join me in using that term.6. mix together all the ingredients for the tomato sauce – add water just to get a spreading consistency. spread over the pizza.want to get to know better

highly narcissistic), narcissus’ refusal of both male and female love points toward an almost asexual orientation (apart from his attempted/thwarted autoeroticism), and as a result he may appeal to the mystically-inclined of particular stripes who favor celibacy and sexual sublimation. as early as the myth was told, there was debate over its meaning, with the belief that narcissus was not literally in love with himself, but legitimately thought it was another person he saw, with this view prevailing often into modern philosophical discourse. it could be a vision of the “masculine inner double” or “twin,” the projection of one’s animus-ideal spoken of by queer jungians (e.g. robert hopcke), and discussed as early as plato’s symposium. the failure to realize this projection of one’s desires onto an exterior reality that rarely meets one’s standards is a difficulty which is at the root of many relationship difficulties in the lives of gay men.i remember taking a parenting class when my daughter was five, and my son 18 months and the teacher asked the class what attributes we hoped our children would have when they left the home at 18. wow, talk about planning ahead! she told us to go home and have our spouses fill out the paper as well, and compare. that was an interesting exercise, as many of our spouses had differing views regarding the top five attributes. once we did

themselves. instead, he proposes to understand them externally, by transferring our knowledge of mechanical devices as hypothetical stand-ins. having made the metaphorical substitution of machine for world or organism, however, descartes is also able to substitute a pragmatic view of the aims of inquiry for a theoretical one: since there is a surplus of possible mechanical constructions which could be made to stand in for any natural entity, the choice between them is made on the ground of what works best (and if the model works better than its natural counterpart, then it a truer example of the original function than what is in nature).

this is the first time i’ve listened to an audiobook of the series and i feel that lorelei king did a great job at portraying all of the different characters. there is some heat to this series as well, and it doesn’t let up in this third book. charley and reyes are still hot and heavy and cookie is still trying to live vicariously through charley’s stories. there is no lack of action, if anything there might be more within this read. i can’t wait for the fourth book, fourth grave beneath my feet or the start of her new ya series death and the girl next door.\\r\\nbeware of your thoughts and what you nurture in yourself. your thoughts and actions will turn out to be who you are.\\r\\nacute lead poisoning, while less common, shows up more quickly and can be fatal. in such cases, children are almost always affected. symptoms such as the following may occur:\\r\\nnow here\\'s my question. the young nawab had unimagineably large heaps of wealth, the commission, by the way, at the time was top-secret, nobody in the firm was to know who it was they were making this for.\\r\\ni didn\\'t expect it to change so easily or so well but my new dreamt up laundry makeover works!!!

i am so reminded of the council of nicea, huh? orthodoxy, orthodoxy, is our cry. o-r-tho-dox-y. are we in it? well, i guess! orthodoxy, orthodoxy, yes, yes, yes!now, i think there is an important distinction to be made here: some parents proudly brag about how their teens aren\\'t \"rebellious,\" and what they really mean is that their children are obedient to their parents wishes (or, possibly more likely, are simply very good at hiding the aspects of their life that their parents would disapprove of). when i say that most unschoolers i know, myself included, don\\'t or didn\\'t \"rebel\" against our parents in our teen years, i don\\'t mean it\\'s because we fit the perfect-child model of some narrow-minded authoritarian-parenting suburbanite.my bud. baby. lovebug. snuggle bunny. pumpkin pie. looove my sweet baby boy. he will always be my baby boy. even when he\\'s 50 :) he was chatting and singing while i shot these, hence the constant state of open-ness that his mouth is exhibiting.location: itta bena, msas the film opens, simon and his band perform the title song at the agora ballroom in cleveland. the mise en scène studiously captures both the vocal and instrumental labors of the group (there\\'s a significance to this dual attention), with close views of the kick drum and guitar fretboards: this is a group with musical talent. also, when the scene begins, we are mid-set, and every band member is in full concentration, dripping with sweat: this is a serious, industrious group.this wine is a combination of two of my favorite things: watermark restaurant -nashville & pinot noir. amarone is my #1 favorite wine but a very close second is pinot noir. it is interesting because they seem to be on the opposite ends of the spectrum. amarone is bold, thick, rich, earthy, late harvest almost port-like while pinot noir is subtle, light, complex. i prefer the barnyard, old world style of burgundy.rupert murdoch would have been proud of them – assuming they were not already working for him…sam harris, in ‘letter to a christian nation’, points out that if the bible got the easiest moral question that humanity has ever faced, wrong, slavery. what are the odds that the bible got something as complicated as human sexuality wrong. one hundred percent.you are now (likely) just days away from the end of the spring 2012 semester. that my friends, deserves a cheers! equally as exciting is the warm(er) weather upon us. summer is right around the corner and visions of barbeque cook-outs, corn on the cob, and freshly squeezed lemonade fill our heads.so early in the week i headed to my parent\\'s to help them get ready for the storm. i was already planning some time off there for one last summer trip of kayaking, beaching and relaxing, but instead it became time spent elevating, stowing and battening. like many, we also watched a lot of television trying to determine how bad irene was going to be, and what needed to be done in case of each possible scenario. i can\\'t imagine living far from the coast, but one of the prices of that choice is having to deal with these sorts of events. so you remember what has happened before, do all that you can in preparation for what\\'s to come and hope for the best.keeep in mind that no matter what it wont’ be anything like i imagine orterrible stuff will get to you all by itself. and don\\'t think anyone up there will yank you out of it at the last minute. trust me on that one - most of my associates got roughed up pretty bad.my problem with sharing them here is that (although crystal-clear digital recordings) the machine does not transfer them digitally to computers!unless i buy an expensive bit of new hardware,the only way i can do it currently is to record them on video via a pair of headphones linked to the walkman.not ideal, a sharp loss in quality.just like in ancient india.experts claim the statistics represent a mere fraction of a \\'tidal wave\\' of offending in counties across the midlands and the north of england which has been going on for more than a decade.if anyone asks, “i’ve had it for years!“to-wit to-woo!

i can\\'t thank autumn enough for all the goodies!!ask yourself: who gave them the right to judge israel and find it wanting? is it the fact that israel was the only democracy in the middle east (and may return to that status if iraq does not succeed)? is their judgment at all connected to their similar judgments about america and her presence in the middle east? and how do they manage to blind themselves to the presence of hezbollah in beirut or hamas in palestine? what part of “jihad” do they fail to understand?in chile, operating through the special operations research office (soro), project camelot supported cia plans to overthrow the democratically elected government of salvador allende imposing general augusto pinochet’s military junta on chile on 11 september 1973.round 21 & 22: ch1. sc in each dc and sc around.

we\\'re so glad you stopped by to visit!some words really get on my nerves because their indiscriminate use has by now stripped them of whatever meaning they might have had in the past. the words sustainable and green - used with pseudo-ecological sanctimoniousness in every conceivable context - are currently my linguistic emetics. as far as i can see, the only remaining meaningful way to use these two words today is in advertisements like this one:day 4 - favorite villainsantorum: damn right - i hate allbut languages constantly evolve and i think terms like the ones in mashable’s list although sometimes ridiculous, show the creativity and humour in language. and in the right context using completely new, colourful and funny language can be very effective. for example humour and a relaxed attitude to language can brighten up dull presentations and make them much more memorable – and personal. i often found the university lectures that were the most engaging and memorable were the ones in which the lecturers didn’t just read out notes written in proper english, but who improvised, used the language as they would do talking normally and who used humour.there is also the introduction of text messaging and cell phones as hindrances to human relationships. mattie and josh’s relationship has been “reduced to text messaging” while one of the group texts mattie from two feet away asking her to dance, to which she replies in person “i’m right here”to suicide. designed to reach a wider demographic than those willing todrink entire pitcher by the end of each day.i picked up this excellent lp this past weekend knowing absolutely nothing about the band, however i did notice that this record was on the guardian label who also brought us the might mythra.thanks goes out to all of you for the inspiration you provide me. it\\'s a great thing to have a piece of my heart grow with your continued advancement in the blogosphere.when my colleague and i drove home on sunday night we stopped for some dinner along the way. i shouldn\\'t have bothered: it all came out again on the way home. needless to say monday was spent recuperating a little. yesterday was a fairly easy day and today will also be an easy day: i have to work later this afternoon. since i know where i am going, it shouldn\\'t be too hard.the eater websites, including eater la, eater ny, eater sf, etc., have long been the bottom feeders of the food blogging world. they traffic in gossip, rumor-mongering and celebrity watching like a food-world national enquirer. they\\'ve even used one of my own photos without credit (which raises questions about both their ethics and taste - since my photos largely suck). and they do all of this without any apparent interest in actual cuisine.in my next post, i\\'ll introduce you to our newest family member!i don\\'t know about you, but i only have 21 more days of school!! oh, it is bittersweet. i have really, really, enjoyed my kids this year and i will be sad to see them go. summer brings free time... time for me to do some serious wedding planning (166 days to go!), play with my new cricut, and hopefully purchase a house with my fiance. i know it will be a busy summer.ta keo is deemed as a giant temple mountain based from inscriptions which identified it as “the mountain with golden peaks”. it stands out for being the first of such great undertakings to be completely built with sandstone, hence its orangey color. its appearance looks massive because it was not finished, and the temple carvings inside had only begun when the work on the temple stopped.as a customer service/project manage/pl/admin, your job is results, and people will respond faster to someone they enjoy working with, rather than that old demanding grump. personality is king. stuffiness died along side “life long careers”. sure, there are times a professionally written email is required, and should be treated with the utmost care…but too many times we forget the current transition in generations. good bye baby boomers, hello generation y.my name is emily and i’m a recovering lazy-holic. if you are one too, i can tell you that there is hope. you can change, you are in charge of how you treat yourself and how you go through each day. be accountable to yourself, find a friend and be accountable together. just do it. do it because you matter, and your family matters and because you’ll fell better after the detox, i promise!most of all, archie loves us. he especially loves me. and, being an energetic young border collie, he loves to walk.while she never once uses the term “classical conditioning” or allude to pavlov, her instructions are clear. pair the conditioned stimulus (lovey/music/bedtime routine) with the unconditioned stimulus (however the baby normally falls asleep, i.e. on the booba) so that it is associated with the unconditioned response (sleep). eventually, the introduction of the conditioned stimulus (lovey/music/bedtime routine) will result in a conditioned response (sleep). it worked for pavlov in getting a dog to drool on command. it worked when i taught beloved dog how to pee on command. why didn’t i think of it as a way to get babby to sleep on command??it happens to match the environmentalist movement happening right now. there are quest lines aimed at stopping a deforestation (of ashenvale forest). in the burning crusade, the fel reaver is a colossal enemy war machine portrayed as highly destructive. in general, many enemies are associated with trying to destroy the environment, and this is an idea that definitely rings in our current society.dear kgr: good question. typically, when the borrower on a reverse mortgage dies, moves out, or the property is sold, the reverse mortgage comes due.and if you are a woman reading this you are in danger.once braided, transfer your loaf onto a lightly floured baking sheet. let it sit for 30 minutes to rise for the third and last time.welcome to vintage dutch girl etsy!

in addition to them, we got everything besides the cash back. we had already canceled all but one of the cards ( including, it turns out, one that was not with is, or at least not returned). thankfully, we had not canceled one of them because of issues getting online access. that means that we also now have access to money. so, while we lost a day under very stressful circumstances, and thus will not be climbing the mountain we came here to climb ( where taichi was invented, by the way), we will be continuing on our way, only marginally worse for wear and with a broadened appreciation of the possible kindness of (chinese) strangers.and just rememberperhaps more impressive are their cocktails. i had the pleasure of trying the big apple with leopold brothers\\' ny apple whiskey, campari, apple cider, lemon and bitters. it might look almost too sweet and fruity on the menu, but it\\'s definitely not - the campari\\'s herbal bitterness definitely tempered the other ingredients, and the cider is more about the bubbles than sugar, making this a delightful daytime sipper.will the settlement actually benefit consumers, as the doj claims? it\\'s far too early to predict, but that isn\\'t stopping people from trying. many of the expressions of dismay that greeted the settlement cite fears of less choice and competition, as the level playing field created by uniform pricing is dismantled, and amazon continues to consolidate its already commanding dominance of the ebook market. other commenters disagree, with familiar criticism of the publishing industry.the age of 18 by catholic priests between 1950 and 2002.moscow is one of the world’s largest cities, with about 8.3 million people. a massive fortress in moscow, called the kremlin, is the traditional seat of russia’s head of state, as well as moscow’s most famous landmark. this part of the city is surrounded by thick walls and includes many palaces and cathedrals.4 periodspeaking or praying in tongues is one of the more controversial gifts of the holy spirit (as per, 1cor. 12 ff) because many see praying in a language you don’t understand as a demeaning of our persons – especially our intellect. after all how can it be prayer at all if you don’t know what you are saying? how can spouting what appears to be a bunch of gibberish be called prayer? this mystery can only be understood if we properly understand that man has been endowed with a capability to transcend the natural – that capability is embedded in what scripture calls the “spirit” of man.o\\'hanlon\\'s brewing co. ltd. thomas hardy\\'s ale (2003-2008)a 2005 study by yale university law professor paul gewirtz and yale law school graduate chad golder showed that among supreme court justices at that time, those most frequently labeled “conservative” were among the most frequent practitioners of at least one brand of judicial activism — the tendency to strike down statutes passed by congress. those most frequently labeled “liberal” were the least likely to strike down statutes passed by congress.in fact, everyone has slimmed down, which is a good thing! coco\\'s almost down to her \\'showcat\\' weight, having lost 13 ounces and she looks mah-vah-lous. brighton has lost 6 oz and is just right at 8# 2 oz. sammy is still nomming on the leftover 5% carb young again and even he dropped 8 ounces, too.the everyday, run-of-the-mill, ordinary adventures of the weeds. i will no longer be struggling to understand french or have complaints about the foreign swiss culture, but i am certain there will be plenty of adventures right here in mid-west usa. adventures in cooking, reading, photography, reverse culture shock, grocery shopping, organizing, gardening and bargain hunting...to name a few. they may not be adventures in switzerland, but there will bei hope the british don\\'t expect an apology from this administration over that betrayal. that could only happen if the british engage in terrorism to kill americans and threaten to turn new york city into a sea of fire with their nukes. do that and he\\'ll apologize for winning the battle of saratoga in 1777.no, the purists hanker after proper beer mats that advertise ales of some sort or gild the lily of some brewery or other. but even keg mats, unappealing as they may be aesthetically, will do in a pinch. however, pub chains such as wetherspoons have hastened their decline and even my local keeps them on the bar for discretionary use.true, ultimately all authority is derivative from god himself but i fail to see how this establishes a partite kingdom in a witness sense. god is a unique being, and only he is sovereign over all. only he is able to rule from heaven over all the earth. jesus is said to have david’s throne, a rulership which is terrestrial, earthly, though god-given. (luke 1:32-35)perhaps the best illustration of the effects of the w/p ratio can be seen chart 6 of carter\\'s paper. this chart lists the \"fired\" compressive strength of various mixtures.so… point

those plot bunnies. i’ve got too many of them in there, i don’t need more.you are very resilient souls and it seems remarkable to us that you have such a strong sense of survival. your experiences have been very challenging yet you somehow see your way through. it is that which makes you very respected and admired, as that quality will see you put those experiences to good use when you work with evolving beings. it is usual for ascended souls like you will shortly be, to seek opportunities to serve others. there are always new civilisations coming along, and the creators never cease bringing more into being. no one quite knows how many there are, and space with its endless dimensions is teeming with life that goes on into infinity. indeed the supreme creator is forever dreaming new life forms into existence, and these will follow a similar path of evolution to your own.i can\\'t help but think how very lucky i am.all that i no longer believeyesterday\\'s photoshoot was laid

the opposition are objecting the role of the house speaker in this process, as they accuse him to have the power to pre-select 22 non-mp committee candidates (such as academics and ngos) before the parliament decides on them.photo credit: lynelle wilcoxi love you, aimeewe didn\\'t want him to suffer much longer but definitely needed time to say goodbye. we had less than 24 hours to spend with fritz and make his last day with us special. he was let back upstairs for the night where he enjoyed time walking on my sofas and cuddling up with me in bed for the night. we picked up extra food and made sure the plate was full through the night.needless to say, this story is terrifying, and an amazing tale of intense courage and unimaginable faith. and it is a crazy read, mainly because ming videotaped most of his interrogations of mary and the transcripts are included. the part when mary is like, \"wait, you were in my algebra class 15 years ago?\" is pretty surreal. also, lots of ming\\'s super weird x-rated fan fiction is included. he had a thing for white underwear and tv moms.i think i was doing ok with the struggles this time around until dougal and glenna were sent to america. i suppose it just didn\\'t seem hopeless until then. at least they still had each other. i wasn\\'t really a fan of the struggles they were still enduring by the end of the book though. i guess i thought they had been through enough and just wanted to read about more of their happiness together.my brother pat is a very outgoing, gregarious person. he is loud and bossy and self-directed. he was my mother’s favorite because of his personality which was much like hers. he is always surrounded by an entourage. he is an entrepreneur. as a child, he frowned frequently in pictures. he has always been stocky and a bit overweight. today he has diabetes and some health problems. he has a wholesale american southwest and mexican import business, a tree farm, a pennsylvanian blue stone quarry business, and owns several apartment buildings in the city where he lives. he has never married though he has had several girlfriends who have had children and he has been extremely good to those children. he is still concerned with two grandchildren of one of his grandchildren who lived with him for most of their growing up years and tries to remain in their lives. he is good to his nieces and nephews. he read a lot and researches quite a bit about the things he sells. he also is interested in fossils and gemstones. he can be a bit difficult but i’m glad he’s my brother.tobacco and shampooi actually had three unpublished books. there was one unpublished adult crime novel, a lincoln perry novel, which to me is the first one. and then when i was at high school i wrote two young adult novels, and i count those, even if nobody else does (chuckling), because they showed me how to write books from beginning to end, and that’s a really huge part of the writing process; to just develop the discipline to stick with a story over how many weeks or months. so i’d written three novels, and i was working as a journalist. i’d covered everything from police beat to sports reporting, and about everything in between.“all-in,” was all i could say.baltar: “i see angels. angels in this very room. now i may be mad but that doesn’t mean that i’m not right. because there is another force at work here. there always has been. it’s undeniable. we’ve all experienced it. everyone in this room has witnessed events that they can’t fathom let alone explain away by rational means. … our loved ones. dead. risen. whether we wana call that god or gods or some sublime inspiration or a divine force that we can’t know or understand it doesn’t matter. doesn’t

that there’s a computer in front of them, a “series of tubes,” and then…it gets kind of foggy. it’s like they think there are magical pixies from the land of lulz on the other end, as opposed to their family, friends, co-workers, and old boyfriends who are obsessively poring over their facebook page.and the work of the holy spirit,i am currently working on a \\'learn to sew\\' post, another request

keep the ideas flowing for the duration of a book. this story is entertaining and amusing throughout, and at times extremely funny. i got through it in a day which reflects both the fact that i

then leave. if she hadn’t nested where she had, i would actually walk farther in her direction than what i do, and spend more time there because i have a good view of the pond from that point. in a

donate or collect lice. the actual mechanism by which the donation or collection occurs is not known – it’s not like trading lice is a common mouse lemur pastime, but it is probably linked to close contact via nest-sharing and other aspects of social ecology. social interactions also increase during the breeding season, when the males are out on the prowl for the lay-deez. there seemed to be no (identifiable) overarching factor driving the movement of lice within the population.today is the very last day and i will attend a concert by van beethoven, again conducted by rattle. i\\'m

modification:i was looking around for something to read, bored out of my mind by some sinclair lewis novel i downloaded for free from the gutenberg project, when i noticed that someone in the house had removed an old time-life book from the bookshelf in the dining room so they might employ it as a mousepad for some murderous game played on a laptop while sitting on the couch eating goldfish and watching family guy. that\\'s the level of respect we have for books these days, they\\'re mousepads. these old time-life books, a series called \"the old west\", belonged to my wife\\'s father, and they\\'ve done nothing but collect dust since the turn of the century and well before that, i\\'m sure. and it was not with purposeful disrespect that the person in question decided it made a good mousepad, but a careful study of its smooth, leather-ish exterior determined it had the right reflective properties and gripping strength to be used for something. what are those stupid decorations in the dining room all about? the things with the paper inside them that look like perfect laptop mousepads?here in cartmel’s tenure, when the doctor gives up screen time, it’s primarily given to his

to decaffeinated coffee with one sweetener and no milk takes more than thirty days of forcing the stuff down your throat until you acquire a taste for it. i speak from experience but that’s how i take my coffee these days. it’s drinkable; i’ve got used to it, but i can’t say that i prefer it; i just acknowledge that it’s better for me, especially considering the number of mugs of coffees i can go

who won the 1975 grand national on l’escargot. he followed in his father’s footsteps when partnering bobbyjo, trained by tommy, to a popular victory in the 1999 grand national. that success came two years after he lifted the topham trophy over the big aintree fences aboard joe white. his brother philip is also a successful rider, while his sister nina is a leading amateur. over more than a decade, carberry has forged a reputation as one of the most stylish jockeys – a talent nurtured through hunting, show jumping and point-to-pointing in ireland. he rides principally for noel meade in ireland. carberry was irish champion in 2001/02 and 2002/03. nicknamed ‘alice’ in the weighing room, carberry is a renowned party person and once suffered a bizarre injury when being head-butted in the stomach by a deer while out hunting. he has been successful aboard numerous high-class horses including harchibald, iktitaf, direct route, dorans pride, beef or salmon, limestone lad, go native, looks like trouble and pandorama. he has partnered 12 winners at the cheltenham festival. carberry made the headlines for the wrong reasons in 2006 when he was sentenced to two months imprisonment for setting fire to a newspaper on an aer lingus flight, although this was reduced to community service on appeal. in october, 2009, he failed a breath test for alcohol before riding at naas and was banned from riding for 30 days. he has now resolved not to drink again until his riding career is over and has recorded the highs and lows of his life to date in the autobiography “one hell of a ride”, which was published in october, 2011. john smith’s grand national record: 1994 rust never sleeps (fell 27th); 1996 three brownies (6th);i was going to make a pumpkin apple pie for thanksgiving

upsurge amounted to 43.5% in the breslau electoral division, 48% in liegnitz - both in lower silesia - but only 29.2% in upper silesia, where the catholic centre remained strong. the communists were also stronger in upper silesia than in lower silesia, though they only got 17% even there. as the world knows, in 1933, paul von hindenburg, the president after whom my mother\\'s birthplace had been renamed, faced with the danger of civil war, decided to invite adolf hitler to become chancellor. that was in january. on 27th february the reichstag went up in flames, and the purge of the left

where that market dominance is detrimental to suppliers in the longer term, consumers will also be disadvantaged.\\'\\' to say there\\'s an enormous power imbalance in the supply chain\" is just the most extraordinarily wild understatement, but it\\'s hard to imagine the liberal party actually doing anything about the situation even if they were in government because of their business-friendly attitude and their economic-libertarian tendencies. the national party would huff and puff but in the end the views of the larger partner in the coalition would win out. the labor party is unlikely to do anything because if it did it would be blamed for any price increases felt by consumers. it would fall to the greens to support the agricultural sector in australia, but they are unlikely to lead a majority government for the forseeable future. in coalition with labor their views would also be smothered. but what can government do, anyway. probably not much.the state senate passed a bill last

language used – fate of the whole world being one – it is important to understand the scale of the threat, and why there are no easy and quick solutions. the risks from spent fuel have been known almost since the beginning of nuclear power – the radiation levels are so high that without shielding, direct exposure to spent fuel rods is fatal. despite this knowledge the world proceeded to deploy nuclear power reactors – led by the united states – that has created a total global inventory of over one quarter of million tons. most of this is stored in water filled pools. in addition to creating a massive plutonium stock – 2500 tons (contained in spent fuel) and compared with the micro-grams that were valued above gold in 1944 by the engineers running the manhattan project – the spent fuel crisis has spread worldwide to every nation operating nuclear reactors.i remember you looked at me and said “you are beautiful girl but you are mean. you are getting me in trouble.” all i have to say

saul alinsky’s book “rules for radicals” which is really a book for the new marxists in this 21st century. i’m actually glad obama is exposing himself and his true leanings because we now have a

blockbuster adaptation. coming to the story blind, i thought they did a good job setting up the world and characters. i dug the whole retro-future look of it all. the train ride was cool: \"that is

influence. for many, singing in praise to god with the rest of the church provides the connection. but, should people anticipate weekly worship as the most significant time to meet with god? i wouldn’t be surprised if a large percentage of people find their connection with god during small group discussions, while serving others, after making what was learned on sunday a part of real life during the week, or even during the thought process involved with writing (or reading) a blog.i remembered that even when i was younger, i already had an inclination to teach. i loved to talk and give advice; i wanted to be a priest at one point since i thought it would be cool to give ‘unboring’ homilies. back in grade school, i would often substitute for my teachers whenever they’re absent. in high school, i joined an organization that reached out to public school children. i taught catechism for two years at the balara elementary school, and i loved interacting with the kids. and in

the bill will cover fewer and fewer people than advertised. according to a report from the congressional budget office released last week, obamacare will leave 27 million americans uninsured by 2022. this represents an increase of 2–4 million uninsured over previous reports. moreover, it should be noted that, of the 23 million americans who will gain coverage under obamacare, 17 million will not be covered by real insurance, but will simply be dumped into the medicaid system, with all its problems of access and quality. thus, only about 20 million americans will receive actual insurance coverage under obamacare. that’s certainly an improvement over the status quo, but it’s also a far cry from universal coverage — and not much bang for the buck, given obamacare’s ever-rising cost.strangely, neither kiran nor co-host john roberts apologized nor even mentioned the apparent slip-up. however, am executive producer jamie kraft apparently noticed: he did not run the story again

he used the hebrew scriptures. paul used the old testament to show that jesus was the messiah; yeshua hamashiach in hebrew. it’s amazing to me how many churches, pastors, and christians are willing to throw aside the hebrew scriptures calling them outdated or not relevant for today. we see jesus all through the old testament! he’s in genesis, exodus, leviticus, and all the way through the psalms and into the prophets. friend, you cannot throw out the hebrew scriptures without saying that jesus is no longer relevant. some would try to say that there are other paths to god. it is true that all paths do lead to god, but there’s only one path that leads to heaven. everyone will stand before god, but without jesus, you will be eternally separated from heaven and god at that meeting.activity

to various environments and lots of people. i wondered if he recommended working abroad to get a different perspective and enhance creativity. his point of view wasn’t what i expected to hear but nonetheless, very logical, “we live connected now, so even if you don’t work abroad you are heavily exposed to global work, to good work (and bad too). you can learn from it even if you haven’t been there. just have to look for it.” on the other hand, living in different places and having unique experiences makes you “interesting”, which have been stressed by advertising professionals everywhere.it was the longest two minutes of my life. i sat on the edge of the bathtub hutched over the two tiny screens. as a sexual active person i have taken my fair share of pregnancy tests. and

college falmouth when she made this announcement to the group of aspiring journalists.here are my tools used to make the stencil:mr. coenie pitout (35), father of 2 little girls was shot 4 times by 3 intruders who broke into the family\\'s home. mr. pitout\\'s wife woke him up when she heard noises. wrongly assuming his wife had heard the children he did not take any weapon with him. on entering the kitchen he was shot in the left cheek at close range by one of three intruders who confronted him. he put up a fight and was stabbed and shot a second time. the report then states that he managed to free his one daughter from one of the attackers so both girls could get to their mother in the bedroom which has somewhat sinister implications. the mother then broke a window and fled to the neighbours.scoop the dough onto a parchment- or silpat-lined baking sheet. try baking one cookie first and see how well they are spreading. you may want to flatten the dough slightly with damp fingers

beside him, feel how much, in spite of the differences, our ventures came together, in the unthought and the heartrending. the reason for beckett’s critical silence after the war is perhaps best expressed when he ends a letter about van velde: “i am no longer capable of writing about.” such thought, such writing, is mere relation. the contradiction inherent in making such statements cannot go unnoticed: “to write is impossible but yet impossible enough”. there is also a need to speak. to thomas macgreevy he writes of his “feeling of helplessness ... and of speechlessness, and of restlessness also i think, before works of art”.he\\'s going to be a monsterby bryan fischerfor me it’s a sign of büchner’s genius that the play manages to convey so much on so many levels. yes, it’s about a struggle of political ideas and practices, but there is also the psychological struggle between the main protagonists, intensely played out at points.a health exchange is one of the main

washed down with my breakfast drink, hoping to mitigate the aching in my body, although even as i consumed the analgesic i knew that the ache in my heart and soul was far more formidable, and far less likely to be susceptible to the effects of the ibuprofen, but there was no pill i could take for that.this time round i intend to follow this up by answering a few of the questions i received following this post (and my design you own textbook post)it is unmistakably brautigan. and i’ll be honest a little brautigan can go a long way; he is like beckett in that respect. his style is laconic, repetitive and expressed in the simple, straightforward language that poor people living on welfare in any one of a thousand small towns will use happily turning nouns into verbs whenever it suits their needs. the setting in this book is a succession of dreary towns in oregon but you could shift the action to louisiana or south dakota and not bat an eye.at this point i’m thinking “maybe everybody else knows this and i’m the only one who doesn’t”… but a part of me is still sceptical. it sounds like some kind of an elaborate prank. well i guess this is real.around the table –and i’m

how very worried i was for all of us, certain that we were on the verge of disaster. and then i was struck again by how much better these past few months have been than we thought they would be, by the fact that we are still a happily functioning family, by the fact that my boy still races around with a smile on his face, full of energy and light and laughter.this week\\'s lovely sponsors are

part v three themes are employed: the journey towhen i think about the times when i live in the moment. on the allotment, where i often just turn up, whatever mood i\\'m in, whatever the weather. i don\\'t always know what i\\'m going to do. i just turn up and start somewhere on the plot... pulling up weeds for example, or planting something, or like last weekend, clearing the paths of weeds, covering them and putting chippings down. most of the time, i focus on what i\\'m doing. it\\'s very practical, often repetitive, and involves exertion. i\\'m conscious of what i\\'m doing, and whether it\\'s hot, the birds chirruping, the strimmer somewhere on the plot, when the sun goes behind the clouds, whether i\\'m thirsty or not, how wet or dry the soil is, how it feels to dig the fork into the ground, the smell of the soil. i still think about other things, but the thoughts come and go. often i can arrive in a bad mood or a tired mood or preoccupied and it works out by the time i finish. i notice what has grown a little more, i notice everything. it\\'s the time when i am most observant of what\\'s around me, but also observant of how i feel in a very uncomplicated way.now, i don’t have children, but my friends who do, speak of “pregnancy amnesia,” the phenomenon in which a mother forgets all the pain and anguish that accompanied her pregnancy so she is willing to go through the process again. i would say that the writer’s journey to publication is a bit like this, because no writer would willingly put themselves through all the torment and pain of rejection if it weren’t for some form of temporary amnesia.pua claimed kumpulan europlus bhd was not qualified to take up the project.the counterpoint to carrie’s passive drift upward is, of course, hurstwood’s passive drift downward. it may at first glance appear that hurstwood’s ruin is owing to an overt act — stealing money from his company’s safe — but even that is a kind of drift. he can’t explain it even to himself: it’s like a stranger’s voice in his head.with this heat?although this is a work of historical fiction there is a certain amount of realism. fogelström presents a well researched book where actual events are incorporated into the book. one of the things i appreciate about this series is that the characters are never given an important part in the historical events of the time. rather we see them through their eyes, the eyes of the normal person. that makes the books more real to me. one criticism of sorts is that the main characters are incredibly good. it can get a bit grating at times but at the same time makes an important point of not giving into your circumstances.soldier\" 5:03harvey\\'s not to every ones taste, and he seems to evoke a \\'marmite\\' style divide - love him or hate him. mrs p is interested in a number of comics, but has never warmed to his work (although she did really enjoy the film adaptation of american splendor a few years back). she finds him just too grouchy and his stories just too mundane... which ironically are the two things i love the most about his stuff! but i guess i see more of myself in harvey than mrs p does! on the face of it, his work may not look like anything special... a story about the growing awkwardness of someone giving him a lift to work, a conversation he\\'s overheard in a shop, how a vague acquaintance became a better \\'friend in need\\' than any of his true \\'friends\\' when help was needed.... it\\'s everyday stuff. but scratch beneath the surface and see yourself staring right back. i don\\'t find gold in every story, occasionally one will leave me a bit \\'non-plussed\\' thinking \"and??\" at the end of it. but that\\'s the nature of this particular beast, and no doubt someone somewhere read the same thing and it really spoke to them. i remember reading one of his comics where he was reminiscing about old relationships, how the break-ups had affected him, his thoughts on love and loneliness etc. it was really profound and i kept re-reading it over and over again.the trio were arrested by police on march 18 in a sting at durban’s battery beach.examining the structurein the rwandan genocides of 1994, more than 800,000 people were killed in a matter of weeks; that is roughly the population of san francisco or austin, tx. roughly 400,000 people have died in the sudan in the last few years as a result of deplorable living conditions brought on by a civil war; that is roughly the population of miami, cleveland, or tulsa. in the \"war on terror\" in iraq and afghanistan, reliable estimates put the total death toll at somewhere around 919,967, which includes 5,885 us service members; this is roughly the population of san jose, ca, or indianapolis. the wars in the balkans in the early 90s caused deaths equal to the population of cincinnati. combined, these deaths of just these few wars would equal the population of chicago.if you have time i would also recommend a day trip up to shenzhen. i guess the first thing to note is that it’s a fun place but not for the scenery. a city on the border of hk in china, it’s basically the retail outlet for the whole of the pearl river delta - the manufacturing hub of china. anything you buy that says ‘made in china’ which, ahem, is just about everything, probably comes from somewhere in the prd. catch the east rail line and it takes about an hour. shenzhen is over the border at lo wu, the very last stop on the line. you will have to get a visa for the shenzhen economic zone at the entry point (if you don\\'t already have a china visa) and go through immigration - but it’s pretty straightforward. make sure you check whether you are allowed to get a visa, i think it depends on your country of origin – i know australia and nz citizens are allowed but i think it’s more difficult for other countries such as the us. these things change often so check before you go.light boxes are easy to use

’56 gates’, a row of sluices built in 1947 to allow waters to be diverted onto an area of floodplain rather than valuable agricultural land in times of inundation.sure he did. whatever.also slightly hilarious for me is the complete omission of sevilla (and i can’t remember if gary has been or not). i lived with an american last year who was obsessed with this city and would not shut up about it–to the point i got really turned off by the city simply because i was forced to hear so much about it (which i suppose isn’t fair, but oh well). i’ve been to sevilla a few times and while i liked it, it’s not one of my favorite places in spain. good to see gary and the people who helped him compile the list agree with me!munchlax is snorlax’s baby form pokemon. like snorlax, it likes to eat, a

remember in primary school ‘if i die, it’s like going to sleep but never waking up.’ and as hard as i tried to imagine that, it simply didn’t make sense. i couldn’t accept that it just ‘ended’ like that. surely, i thought, there had to be something more.out of the night that covers me,this thanksgiving we had tandoori chicken with stuffing. i used 2 cornish chicken for making this dish. it’s really easy , if you can marinate it over night that would be great . the yogurt should be thick so that the marinade holds on to the chicken, for that what i do is put it on my tea stariner and let it sit for atleast an hr. that really does the trick, it comes out really thick. hope you all will like it.this is an unimaginative and non-thrilling sequel to the 1998 hit the mask of zorro, starring

emotional being? of course i did that before: transitioning from acting male to expressing myself female makes no sense at all, rationally, apart from the fact that i wanted to do it. i so want my rational brain to be able to justify healing work, and it can’t. i grew up having to justify everything rationally, being unaware of my feelings.if you cant deal with then then get out of the

the most democratic food in the world. one can always find an italian eatery or restaurant in almost every continent. italian recipes ar considered to be extremely flavorful on with a wonderful aroma

form of various types of pastas and breads. the most famous of all italian foods ar the pizza and pasta recipes, that have secured a high place in the global cuisine as well. the high popularity of such dishes has also influenced neighboring cuisines such as the american and european cuisine as well.often times when students write “academically,” add in a few extra fancy words, or try to change their style completely, the essay is tough to read. the flow of the paper gets muddled and worse the point you are trying to make gets lost in the chaos. writing according to your style really helps the natural flow of your paper, which in turn helps the reader better understand your message behind the paper. the clarity of your paper is worth so much more than what little authority a few extra

destruction can be stopped and we must stop it. clearly, the river, the land, indigenous humans, and so much more life, are the victims of an abusive system. like all perpetrators, the way to stop them is to aim at the root of the problem and remove or block their ability to abuse. basically, the goal is to return the circumstances to the way they were before the abuse started, with the victims free and safe. the abuse of civilization has been a campaign of 10,000 years, so obviously there is much to be done to stop it. but, what choice do we have other than to start now and try?place meat,

(and if we may be pardoned the suggestion) a little too closely modelled upon jullien’s programmes, not to endanger the germania prestige. but we are glad to see that good overtures and parts of symphonies are not excluded.” he anticipated that the “lights” would outnumber “the rival party” at upcoming concerts, and that the germanians’ revised plan would “test effectually the relative strength of parties in this matter.”so not quite art, perhaps. not at all in b&w.so what about you? do you have a dream you and your husband have been talking about forever? do it!the dev alpha is running a modified version of the playbook os, with the playbook interface and gestures, so there are few clues about the final blackberry 10 user interface.everyone together: (shouting joyfully) we can all make a difference!(7)occupation:last week she was told she would be induced due to \"medical stuff\"and we made arrangements on the spot. i was on the night train to melbourne from sydney to be at the birth of tina\\'s baby.on sunday, july 4th, we walked from our hotel in oakland down forbes avenue through downtown all the way to point state park where we joined in with thousands of people, scattered upon the grass and concrete, to watch the fireworks. we sat behind an family of arabic descent who were sitting next to a young white couple who were sitting next to a black woman and five small children (all boys). we watched sky-divers make a dramatic descent to earth, putting all their faith in a thin piece of silk and a few ropes. we saw people watching from the safety of their hotel rooms behind us. we listened to the thump, thump, thump of the all-america music being played by a dj a short way off in the distance, “born in the usa, i was, born in the usa!” we smelled the bbq, sweat, cigarette smoke, popcorn, and smoke from expended fireworks.the soul thief by cecelia holland – the soul thief is an adventurous look at a turning point in northern european history. christianity is the chosen religion of most, but a few still look to the old pagan gods. mysterious forces dreamily surround the harsh reality of life, adding a fantasy element to the events of this historical time period as twins mav and corban struggle to survive amidst raids, food shortages, and cruel overlords. this book is the first in a five book series. recommended by kimberly s.and on good friday jesus wasn’t dragged to the cross, or forced into the wolf’s den. jesus boldly walked up to the wolf. jesus followed the wolf home without fear or hesitation. he approached the wolf without weapons, without defenses, and without armies. jesus sought out the wolf on his home territory, stood right in his face, and essentially said……give me your best shot. do your worst. i dare you. i can take it.i\\'ve jotted ideas down on receipts, napkins and kids spelling lists. when i am in the zone and spending a lot of time thinking of ideas they often come to me at inconvenient moments. if i don\\'t write them down, i don\\'t always remember them.

alleges that promotions at the agency were decided by a “good old boys network” that kept black agents out of top jobs. and “good old boys” isn’t a metaphor — in the eighties and nineties, white agents actually joined other government employees an annual event called the “good ol’ boys roundup,” where they participated in activities like “the posting of racist signs like ‘nigger check point,’ a simulated lynching of a black man from a tree, and a host of racist skits and songs.” the roundup also elected a “redneck of the year,” a dubious title held by at least one secret service agent. and it was apparently a networking and professional development opportunity — many roundup attendees were later promoted to senior positions with the agency.yes, immigration is an overwhelming experience,

the new york times on philippines overtaking india as the world’s top call centre. americans calling the customer service lines of their airlines, phone companies and banks are now more likely to speak to mark in manila than bharat in bangalore. over the last several years, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the call center business: the rise of the philippines, a former us colony that has a large population of young people who speak lightly accented english and, unlike many indians, are steeped in american culture. more filipinos — about 400,000 — than indians now spend their nights talking to mostly american consumers. the jobs have come from the us, europe and, to some extent, india as outsourcers followed their clients to the philippines. india, where offshore call centers first took off in a big way, fields as many as 350,000 call center agents, according to some industry estimates. the philippines, which has a population one-tenth as big as india’s, overtook india this year, according to jojo uligan, executive director of the contact center association of the philippines. the growing preference for the philippines reflects in part the maturation of the outsourcing business and in part a preference for american english. in the early days, the industry focused simply on finding and setting up shop in countries with large english-speaking populations and low labour costs, which mostly led them to india. but executives say they are now increasingly identifying places best suited for specific tasks. india remains the biggest destination by far for software outsourcing.2 frame mounted water bottles, 1 frame mounted pump, 2 small front panniers, 2 large back panniers, sleeping back mounted on the back rack, small tool kit under the saddle, and a

supplies thrown out at american hospitals. your healthcare dollars at work: if the outside wrapping has been broken, but the individual wrapping is still unbroken/sanitary, the supply cannot be used. if it’s last year’s model, out it goes. partners in world health is basically a huge warehouse in scarborough, me, run by an rn who knows her stuff, and she has enlisted other rns to collect all this

built along england’s southern and eastern coasts between 1804 and 1812, as part of the country’s defences against a possible french invasion. they are extremely solid brick buildings, with outer walls up to 13 feet thick and roofs at least 10 feet in thickness. they are elliptical on the outside with round interiors, meaning that the outer walls vary in thickness, and the thickest walls, in the narrow ends of the ellipse, face the sea. there were very few windows and the entrance was on an upper level, reached either by a retractable ladder or a drawbridge. inside, a garrison of up to 24 men and officers lived and waited to train their cannon on approaching enemy shipping. in the event, the towers were not tested by a french invasion, but some 47 of them remain, rendered obsolete by advances in both armour and artillery, as reminders of an age gone by.thereafter i allowed my pure and sinless body to be wounded from the foot to the head, and to be crucified for all the sins of

huyara.for me, jaws is one of the few movies that lived up to all the hype…and then some. we’ve all gotten amped-up to see uber-promoted blockbusters only to walk out of the theater thinking, “so what?” but jaws was everything i hoped it would be: scary, funny, surprising. it was not the shocking gore-fest mom feared - only five people are actually killed - and the poor little pooch she was so worried about doesn‘t die onscreen…in fact, it’s only implied that he dies. there is that jolting scene of one victim’s head popping at the screen with an eye missing, which scared me so bad my popcorn went flying, but jaws was always more than just a “gotcha” horror movie. leaving the theater, i felt like i saw just something special, more than just another flick my parents dropped me off to see while they went shopping. in ensuing years, not too many movies gave me that same rush. star wars, raiders of the lost ark and escape from new york (i’ll explain that last one later) immediately come-to-mind, and the last movie to hit me with the impact of jaws was pulp fiction.larry b. seabrookaway with the legacy of carrie nation,i had not sat down and focused on the flavor of

a foreign exchange student had a 6month bout of depression because he felt inferior. who made him feel so small you ask? who would be so cruel? who else? the wait staff. how is this possible?? you\\'re wondering, let me give you a little insight into their thought process at various stages in your dining experience:majerus’s experiment was one-sided: that is, he released both types of moths at their naturally-occurring frequencies (a good design) in only unpolluted woods, for polluted woods aren’t around in britain any longer. nevertheless, it’s still a decent test of the bird-predation hypothesis, which under majerus’s conditions predicted that relatively more of the dark moths than of the light moths would be eaten.i seek knowledge by learning from various teachers which includes

people” aliens.another important bit of background information to grapple with for a novice is the idea that planets get in different moods depending on what houses they own. so you can have a benefic in a really “bad mood” if they own difficult houses in the chart. visa versa, you can have a malefic in a very “good mood”. for example when capricorn rises, jupiter owns a “bad house” (the 12th), and this puts him in a “bad mood”. jupiter is always a gentle and benefic planet, but for some rising signs he is in better moods then others.ex-members of the special constabulary and auxiliary police as well as widows and widowers meanwhile received rm3,000.the aliens seemed unsure as to what to do next until the swat and police began to open fire on them. each alien carried what looked to be a cannon connected by some sort of cables to a large backpack they carried. human small arms bullets ricocheted off grey body armor they were wearing. a high-pitched whine began to be heard emanating from the cannons and when the sound peaked, the two began blazing away literally blowing everything they hit into tiny pieces. they even swept the building my little group was hiding behind and within seconds, it was reduced to rumble. only a five-foot length of the back wall remained for us to hide behind.what about people’s names? can they give a clue as to ethnic or racial identities within the plebe? it’s difficult to say. there are certainly many indigenous surnames that occur in the mass of no-category people. name like toapanta, quilago, cañar, tituaña, tutungilla, lema, topan, guamansara, and many others frequently appear without category. it’s just a guess though. in the 1740s, tributaries were still often listed by name, and most indian tributaries by then already had fully hispanized names.6. been in love? - i\\'m in love now and highly recommend it.peridot is the birthstone for august.white balance : auto11 they surrounded me,darcy edwardsthe processes he uses to

sightings of our craft in your skies; they are making themselves more noticeable to you by decloaking in broad daylight and by being more dramatic in your night skies. our message is, you are not alone! further, mother earth is accelerating her transformation into a unified, 5-d-reality being. in the eyes of your geologists and atmospheric scientists, the latest geological indices seem to point to the potential for worldwide catastrophe, but such is not the case. mother earth is indeed drastically altering her weather patterns by changing the jet streams that create the global climate; also, unusual heating and cooling states are changing the very nature of the conveyor belt that mixes the waters of your oceans, and this too influences your weather patterns. however, this is part of a positive process that will eventually bring together the waters and atmosphere of the surface with those of inner earth.“i hate looking at the pictures from when i just came from france, my

wednesday morning. everybody got out their little backpacking stoves and started heating up water. all i really cared about was my first cup of coffee. i poured my instant coffee packets into my cup and waited for my water to boil. aaaah, boiling water to my rescue. someone brought a camp stove also and the others were making eggs, potatoes and bacon. i brought a freeze-dried meal so once again waited moments for some boiling water. i was slightly disappointed in this meal so i ended up eating some fruit and a few mini powdered donuts. i was good to go.i saved this one for last for a number of reasons. one of them is because it features my very good friend jasmine shea and it was her birthday on wednesday and i hope this layout has reached her already. i wrote her a few words on why i think she is amazing. the main reason is because i got a chance to meet her and her family in january, and she has 4 beautiful children and it is just so obvious what a great mother she is and of

laps of spa made eau rouge and pouhon easier than you’d expect, but i’d doubt i’d be brave enough to attempt these turns in 6th gear in a real f1 car. in fact the biggest problem of eau rouge was lining up the car coming down from la source, with a grass kerb to the left of the track and no visibility of the front wheels on the simulator. placing the car was a problem, and although most likely still a problem in a real f1 car, was mainly a downside i’d associate with the simulator. my bad line into eau rouge (once i’d stopped trying to take it in top gear in the megane) was the reason and place for my most spectacular spins. indeed with the simulator you really don’t want to be hitting the barriers, the hard jolt the platform delivers reminds the driver they have crashed, this is no

i must fight to maintain an intimate, growing relationship with him. i must fight to keep the things i love the most from becoming idols in my heart (to the point of being elevated in admiration or affection above christ).to be continued in part 2this year, i am implementing aerobics in my gym class. i plan on teaching students how to take their heart rate and calculate their bmi. i think it\\'s imperative for kids to know just how important keeping active is. it\\'s recommended that kids (and teens) get at least 20 minutes of good aerobic exercise 3 times a week. while searching online for some resources, i found many videos that i can use to show my students before they learn their own routine.most people view the world of social networking as the ultimate time suck. while this may be true for some (i am, admittedly, a twitter addict), social networking can also prove to be useful in forging friendships and comrades-in-writing-arms that can help to make even the most difficult parts of the writing journey shine.for my entree i had les ouffs mourette which exploded with flavour in my mouth and we both had coq au vin washed down with a local wine suggested by our maitre d.this photograph (poland 1947) by jindich marco, portrays a frivolous scene in which soviet army officers are having their photos taken in front of a screen depicting a beautiful springtime, while behind them the devastating reality tells quite a different story.but if i wasn’t working on all of this, i don’t know what i would be doing. i love to be at the helm of projects, the lady in charge!

are you excited? mp let slip (he loves that!) that he has a couple of presents to put under the tree, and i\\'m all flustered in my eagerness for the fun morning to get here. presents! i don\\'t know about you, but i love wrapped things. i\\'m not one for big presents at all--i enjoy my christmas best when the gifts are laid back and whimsical--but i certainly love ripping into things. and i wonder what he\\'ll think about his gift!aubrey\\'s fabulous blog writing aboutyet, at least according to what was revealed in the h-s article, the letter didn’t actually identify any specific areas in which the paper was “both flawed and incorrect,” much less slanderous. it’s not even clear to me who the paper could have slandered.i can say that this is not a clone, but it appears that mr. fulford is still in a state of trauma from his three months of imprisonment off the coast of monaco, daily torture by rothschild’s henchmen, and nightmarish sexual abuse by reptilian rapists. noted european psychotherapists are going to examine fulford and see if the cabal used the physical pain and vile sex to split his psyche and create alters a la mkultra.of layouts of one dd and not many of the other dd. this is not because i like onei will add in a little bit of allsorts all new stash from ribbon to stamps to stickers and patterned papers, enough for you to make a few cards with.our poor master bathroom has needed an update for awhile now, we finally saved up and decided to give it a little help. for some strange reason, there was carpet in there under the sinks. i don\\'t know why anyone would want carpet in your bathroom! first off, we ripped out the carpet and put tile down. we found an awesome tile guy that was super reasonable and a very nice kid. he did an awesome job! he tiled our counter top, floors, and around our bathtub. then we painted the cabinet a chocolate brown and got new sinks and brushed nickel faucets. we got a new light above the sinks at lowe\\'s and we framed out our mirror with some white molding. i love the way it updated our mirror. my hubby put a new rain shower in and a new shower faucet. i panited the walls a really nice gray/khaki color. i went to the \"oops\" paint section at home depot and got it for $5.00! we put in new baseboards and painted all the molding. we did all the work ourselves except for the tile. we did have a dear friend help us with the baseboards. other then that, it was all us! we love our new bathroom! now off to the kitchen...et aspergatur aqua benedicta.oh how the tide has turned fickle and we always were and will remain lovely strangers.i had been going to the cottage every weekend throughout all of this, it somehow restored me and made me sane enough to deal with the next week, but i decided to stay home the last weekend of september as i was just too drained to get ready and make the long drive north.i was at your mercy…this is a modified version of ginger cake from delia smith, the reigning doyenne of british home cooking, who is not to be sniffed at just because she thought it was a good idea to advocate buying canned sliced onions as a shortcut (gross me out with a spoon.), or write a recipe on how to boil an egg (poaching i can understand. but hard boiling? really?).279 1. “thursday afternoons.” kameshwar c. wali, ed., s. chandrasekhar: the man behind the legend (london: imperial college press, 1997), pp. 122-29.

i wanted to make another koala-themed bento because i really like my first koala bento. i thought about using quail eggs and colouring them grey (but i really didn\\'t know (and still don\\'t know) how to get grey-coloured eggs), but then i remembered that not all koalas are grey, there are white ones too, how convenient, in the end i didn\\'t even have to colour anything:). i decided to use mini mozzarella cheese instead of quail eggs to make the two mini white koalas, because i like the idea of eating pilaf with mozzarella. these mozzarella koalas are made out of: mozarella cheese, nori for eyes, black olive for the nose and chili sauce for the rosy cheeks.in a large bowl, add the mayonnaise, mustard, old bay seasoning, worcestershire sauce and egg. mix well. add the crushed crackers and blend well. gently fold in the crab so not to break the lumps (lumps are crab goodness!). cover the bowl and place in the refrigerator for about an hour.for a listing of the beers they serve see the link below:get ready to scrap those school memories with this big kit! contains lots of goodies to help you make fun pages for preschool through high school.yay! you are engaged! now what? with all the social media and inputs we have today, it can be quite daunting for a bride to be to put together a wedding.the context in which the revolution took place would be a pretty good place to start. up to the 1930s, spain was a largely preindustrial country controlled by wealthy landowners, the catholic church, and a series of monarchs and military dictators. meanwhile, revolutionary fervor was brewing. through the turn of the 20th century anarcho-syndicalism grew popular in rural spain, and to a lesser extent in cities as well. the industrial sector was particularly rife with labor conflict. strikes were a regular occurrence, and were often violently broken. many thousands of workers were jailed or killed in numerous strike-busting clashes with bosses, police, and the military. inclose the box by gently pushing down on the lid. take the backing off your sticky strip and gently squeeze the sides of the lid together before sticking down. it will be a little off (as shown) but that’s okay. we can hide this with embellishments!!you don\\'t remember,my name is joni wilson, i am the sole designer of inktegrity\\'s images. inktegrity was started out of my love for card making; my designs are fun for all ages and can be resized to fit your crafting needs. all of my images are inspired by upcoming holidays, everyday life, and friends\\' requests. please visit the store site at: inktegrity and browse through the different categories. happy crafting to you, thank you for creating with inktegrity!cheryl: definitely my kids. my oldest daughter is actually a much better evangelist than i am. at the age of 5, she got into a discussion with one of her classmates about whether god truly existed. she began singing hymns on the bus. she tells everyone that vacation bible school is the best thing ever and they need to come to our church. many of my daughters’ friends have joined us for services over the years at their requests.actually, i did do a good bit of reading, it was just kind of different than what i usually do. my son\\'s online course is an english course called, \"the journey.\" the readings were a really interesting collection, everything from poetry by robert frost, alfred lord tennyson, and mary oliver, to articles by steven covey, to a section of helen keller\\'s autobiography, and a section of kaffir boy. there were also about ten short stories- \"the necklace\" by guy mauipassaunt, “the silver mine” by selma lagerlof, how much land does a man need?

i like to think the archive of the soul has an unlimited capacity, providing it is well organized and maintained. even with that in mind, there must always be an ability to receive and convey without stockpiling.except in the case of the world wars, conscription throughout american history has proven to be highly unpopular and largely ineffective and unnecessary. mr. ricks’ call for a draft to act as a brake on american military involvements would simply not accomplish what he wishes it to accomplish, is unnecessary with our current force structure, and is politically impossible. other than that, it is a grand idea!due to the fear of swelling, chloe\\'s orthopedic surgeon kept a splint on her rather than a cast for the first 9 days, which meant no school. since we didn\\'t know how long she would be out of school, we signed up for homeschooling and her teacher (who just happens to live across the street) came over every day to teach her what she missed in class.this is a sticky posting and will stay at the top until the 17th october when this ends. to find out how to win click here.i think she is very wise.rom 1:21 because that, when they knew god, they glorified him not as god, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.some critics, such as author john clute, don’t consider many high fantasy stories to be fantasy at all, and point to different literary form as the true bearer of the title. why?hello :) not much to share today. we overslept, but i needed it(i finally slept all night with no coughing fits waking me up!). we managed to get school done on time and even some housework and chores. made ranch pork chops for dinner. so easy and so yummy :)so, when i was governor, i fought for — actually, before i was governor, i fought for, during my election and thereafter, a program to have english immersion in our schools so our kids could learn in english. i think we agree on this, which is, you know what? kids in this country should learn english so they can have all the jobs and all the opportunity of people who are here.learn things and get smart. –geppetto (pinocchio)or if you’re with a bunch of friends, you could just point right out at him, and all of you could burst out laughing. there are a lot of things you could do, and i’m sure you could come up with something just as nasty any day!then we tried a windy experiment. we wanted to find out how far wind can move things.called a real brooklyn “character”.(6) 3 resistors r12, r23 and r31 are delta connected. derive expressions for r1, r2 and r3 in equivalent star connected network.to enter the quest for this coveted prize, please read on:so, like any good picture book, this blog has a reassuring ending for anyone finding it hard to be creative right now. don’t add to your stress by worrying about it. get on with your life as best you can – and one day soon, it will be back.their necks tilted back as it approached. it towered at least fifteen feet high.listening to the string quartet, accompanied by a pianist, this evening, i liked the first piece. the second piece sounded to me like a couple of six-year-olds banging on a piano to drown out the cellist, sometimes in harmony with the violin and viola, sometimes not.that poor man is the most self sabotaging man i have ever met. he was gung ho in this job that he has when they first transferred him to another department. as long as he gets pats on the back and is the center of attention, he is happy. but then, it happens that things quiet down and you start to see the decline. he does things self consciously that brings about either failure or downfall of some kind. he no longer cares about getting to work on time. he will never care about that unless there is some girl there that grabs his interest and he wants to talk to her. he has never wanted to be gung ho about supporting us for me. he only does it because he has to. he’ll do it without giving me too much of a hassle if there is a love interest other than me.

that the squad can actually choose anywhere on the map and just go for it and still be in the same game, but… considering that most games do not work like that and there is no tutorial detailing this freedom, it only complicates the start up process more. apparently, the whole point of allowing this zone self-choosing is to give you your own individual bonuses depending on where you go on the map for the games –zinethat’s right, it’s not a misprint; it really does say $.01. so…let me get this straight. six years ago, they miscalculated what i had and sent me a check for a penny less. somewhere along the way some bean counter came across my penny and determined that they needed to spend $0.42 in postage plus the cost of a sheet of paper and envelope, and send me a rather rude looking letter

too. he allowed one single in six innings his first start. in his first full year, he struck out twelve in six innings against montreal. then, of course, in 2003 he had a postseason for the ages, making five starts, compiling a 2.11 era, and capping it off with the world series mvp he won by throwing a complete game, five-hit, nine-strikeout shutout in yankee stadium to clinch the game. it was one of greatest games anyone had ever pitched in the world series.* and beckett was 23 at the time.futures arise from national destinies. in the post-destiny world, there is no future and no past, only a slow decline and decay into a nothingness without shape, substance or form. a nation unmoored from its past has nowhere to go. it cannot make anything new, because there are no new things. its horizons are limited to its geometry, it experiments with shapes and colors, it digs through the trash of earlier eras for things it can use, reviving trends, dumpster diving through history while feeling that other eras were more exciting and more interesting than this.8 oz uk roasted barleyi’ve been on a video game kick lately, ever since went to the sony centre to see some classic final fantasy music performed by an orchestra. well before this (it was march 31) i had come across an article on the globe and mail by chad sapieha (i might have that name spelled wrong) about the latest installation at the smithsonian exploring the idea of video games as art and i was entranced. it’s something i’ve argued for many years, that video games are the epitome of artistic convergence and finally it was being extolled by more than just the sidestream media. i had, however, forgotten that i’m different than most gamers, i like a very, very select few games and regard the majority of them as trash. i should have been reminded of my childhood years spent tracking when the old electric playground was on to get a brief 22-minute glimpse into the world of video games hosted by tommy tallerico — whom i thought at the time exemplified hollywood douchebag. i should have remembered watching the show in horror as they featured the most inane bunch of games that were around those days.

bitter-sweet, but good. i was able to enjoy myself, reflect and feel the flow of love going in and out of my heart. i spent a good amount of time at the cemetery today. and during my earlier visit i journaled. i could have sat there all day. the sense of clarity i felt today was comforting and i realized today, that i am a good mother to both my children. the following were my thoughts as they flowed from my heart to my pen.can we kill it? this far from a sherim, rel didn\\'t fancy trying to draw the creature back to its own realm, but not all wildren could be killed in the first realm. how did you hurt a cloud?family ethics( to be continued )avengers #24.1we get to the diner -- it\\'s full. okay, we go to another diner, the blue fountain down on the lincoln highway. i took the saab, revving it high and stoking more amps into the battery. we get into the diner, sit right down, and that\\'s when cathy and thomas tell me that he had not just forgotten his computer...he\\'d forgotten his dorm room keys as well. but he has them now -- thanks to nora! -- and all\\'s well, and we have a big laugh, and a great last breakfast together before taking thomas back to school. the saab starts, we drive back to the house, leave nora with lots of hugs (and pets to the corgis, who are now thoroughly confused), and get back on the way to boston...over two hours later than planned.rachel renee vickers and clinton ray patterson were both from poverty, but they didn’t meet until they were attending the university of kentucky. rachel went to the private, crimson catholic school for girls, right down the road from poverty central high school where clinton attended. that first week of their freshman year, they passed each other several times in the halls noticing each other every time. before they actually met, they both knew that they were meant for each other. it was love at first sight. when they did meet, they were shocked and surprised that they lived only a few miles apart and had never met. and while attending uk, they were inseparable and were voted “the most loved couple” on campus, four years in a row.it may only be a few that will say this: “i challenge you to bring me even your spirit of divisiveness and contempt, if you can bear to approach me with it.” are you willing to be one with so much faith? are you willing to be emptied out and filled anew with the holy spirit?mr harriott said: \"besides enjoying the rugby, the people who helped us with the incident were very friendly and helpful. this is why we will stay.\"their dumbly curious filamentsmike sharperson wore the no. 27 longer than anyone besides willie crawford. he assumed the number from landrum in 1988 and wore it until 1993.i have new-found appreciation and love for doors. weird, i know. but the right door can make such a difference, of which i was reminded last week when new doors were installed at the house.

neighbor would hear. my attempts to get help went unnoticed and didn’t feel the sting of the needle as kurt stabbed me with a syringe during my tirade. my face went numb as they placed the brunette wig and large sunglasses on me. once at the airport, kurt helped me into the cessna and buckled me in. i only woke once on the trip as my head fell on kurt’s shoulder and he moved. several of joe’s roadcrew were left behind to have the windows replaced before my mother returned home from work that evening.it’s sometimes difficult to appreciate events in history unless you were there. we know the stories handed down to us from tradition, or the media, or a textbook, but the distance tends to numb us to the situation, especially when our world is built on the results of those events. this can be seen in something like the declaration of independence. for americans, who have grown up in the land of the free, we may know about the american revolution, because we grew up here. we grew up without the monarchy, in a system of government that was formed at the time of the revolution and has for us been the “way it’s always been”. for those who lived during the revolution, it must have been very different, a big leap of faith, conflict between those who were still loyal to england and those who wanted independence, setting up a constitution for a new nation, a lot of trial and error and of course a big war to fight to gain it all.“will that test change your management?”the intention was clear: this is too vast for either of us to fathom, so let’s go to the other extreme.as she

considered a “crime” in the “world’s largest democracy.”interesting place, shankar thought, no water, no people. why have station in such a place.thanks to everyone who left comments about our big snow! yes, hubby did get home on sunday and is now back at work on his normal shift! the sun is out today and it makes the snow even more beautiful! we are now preparing for the next big snow - due here on wednesday - and will be going out today to buy some more munchies and kitty litter (i use that instead of the rock salt). the last time we had this much snow was in 2002-2003 when we had about 30\" and i had to go out to make a path for our dear old dog tequila (the kids named her!) a great doberman, german shepherd, pitbull mix, who was the best dog we ever had. she was old and couldn\\'t jump through the snow drifts and wouldn\\'t even consider using papers inside the house; so there i was, with hubby at work and son in the air force, digging her a path so she could go out and \\'do her business\\'! she passed away at the great old age of 15 about 5 years ago and had a wonderful life, so we were sad but also happy that she was with us for so long. the kids are all out of school and i am sure will be heading out to go sledding today. i can see the birds checking out the berries on my winterberry bushes and then taking turns eating their fill. the viburnums have great berries

they will create the same result. problems are there because of things like the lack of discipline, habits, attitudes and the list goes on. to solve some problems you may have to change your attitude or enter into a place of discipline. you have to change fundamentally from who you are to who you should be.did you know astd golden gate was chapter of the month in february? of all the 200+ chapters

nicely on this beer and is full of pine, grapefruit, and other citrus spice, and only really a touch of caramel malt base on the nose. the flavor starts with plenty of hop bitterness followed by a big rush of citrus fruit and resinous pine flavor. the bitterness upfront settled down a bit about half way down my glass and then the caramel malt really provided a decent balance to the hops. i think this beer was brewed with only columbus hops, but if anyone knows for sure please let me know. the wasn\\'t much carbonation in this offering and it left an almost astringent bitterness lingering after the swallow. i am fine with that, but i can see how others would not like that in the finish. i think one bomber was just about perfect for me, and i would very much like to try the other ipa

certainly agree that it definitively shows that the earth becomes god’s domain, but i fail to see where it would specifically identify where the holy ones themselves would be ruling from, since the holy ones are not mentioned specifically in that vision. that’s why i say that this particular prophecy, without a guidepost to direct our interpretation of “kingdom”, does not settle for us the issue of where the holy ones will rule from. naturally, the kingdom is partite, as you are using the word, for it will eternally involve both heaven and earth. the only real question is from “where do the holy ones reign”.this the catwalk :)jaela - everything except for butt whoopin\\'schristianity is growing worldwide.this is probably one of the simplest busy bags to put together. here is what you

(monkey, vine, bananas), plantin schoolbook (scallop border, grass), silhouette playgroundengines were sourced from anotherthe theseus ensemble and geoffrey paterson continue to further their commitment both to perform challenging new music and to provide new ways for audiences to approach it, first and foremost amongst which are paterson’s excellent spoken introductions with musical examples. alexander goehr’s lyric pieces were therefore introduced with brief comparisons between two of schumann’s davidsbündlertänze and two passages from goehr’s work, which is to a certain extent built upon structures and gestures to be found in its predecessor: nothing laboured, nor indeed forbiddingly technical, but a way in for listeners who may conceivably have fretted about what to expect. derivation and transformation, in these particular cases from the eighth and ninth schumann pieces (both florestan), were presented with admirable clarity, as indeed was the performance as a whole, which benefited equally from purposive command of line. particularly striking was the echt-romantic horn melody of the second of the six pieces, ‘sostenuto, ma non troppo lento’, which, when joined by muted trumpet proved suggestive both in sonority and progress of webern’s transcription from the musical offering (bach’s masterpiece another goehr favourite, perhaps far from incidentally). trombone added an almost chorale-like impression, again furthering the sense not only of refracted bach but bach refracted via a refraction of german romanticism. stravinskian coolness from the ensemble’s woodwind offered a welcome counterpoint, in more than one sense. a sense of processional was doubtless furthered by timbral similarities with varèse’s octandre (the scoring is identical) and, inescapably, symphonies of wind instruments. by contrast but also by connection, the liveliness of the third piece, both as work and performance, put me in mind of a more germanic pulcinella. the near-hypnotic repetitions of the fifth piece – already contextualised by that piano excerpt from the sixth schumann piece – were heightened by intensification, again both in work and performance; this is no mere repetition, as paterson’s keen rhythmic sense made clear. indeed, there was a true spirit of the dance, both delightful and threatening. echoes of the boisterous good spirits of schoenberg’s first chamber symphony, surely a contender for the most life-affirming work of the twentieth century, were to be heard in the closing ‘scherzando’, also possessed of an eloquent, wonderfully grainy bassoon soliloquy from rosie burton.yeah, you gotta be five-ten to be an mp. i thought it might have changed by now but no luck.q016) what kind of man is your ideal type?the next

single molecule in this fabulously complex structure were to disappear, or become defective, the flagellum would neither work nor be of any use to the bacterium. the flagellum must have been working perfectly from the first moment of its existence. this fact again reveals the nonsense in the theory of evolution’s assertion of “step by step development.” in fact, not one evolutionary biologist has so far succeeded in explaining the origin of the bacterial flagellum although a few tried to do so.the phone just rang.jerome crouchallen has made some teaa school is charged with attempting to \"educate\" hundreds of students to essentially the same level of competence in numerous arcane subjects. to do so while attempting to ensure that children \"learn\" is a near impossibility, unless the system is set up with rigid controls to cycle through the most people possible - which means that the entire system is set up to deliver to the least common denominator with the least amount of disruption. to combat this and reach maximum efficiency, a school district will resort to virtually any means possible to ensure that students sit still, pay attention, and \"learn.\" take this recent situation, for example; several states have banned the wearing of silly bandz bracelets in their schools, because of the \"distraction\" it presents, which limits learning:i slaved this weekend over

can tell you that most leaders truly care about the reasons why people do or do not perform up to standards. but as many times as i have had this conversation, it usually ends up with us talking about

reaches a planet and is exposed to both sunlight and more tolerable conditions, it starts to grow. if a creature comes too close to the pod, it opens up and releases a long shoot, which grabs onto the

represent the readers and to champion journalistic integrity from within the paper. then-public editor byron calame penned two columns on the lacrosse case. the first, which appeared in spring 2006, minimized even the factual inaccuracies that had marred roberts’ early columns. the second, which came after the exonerations in spring 2007, denied any ideological bias to the times coverage, and

years ago by the work of margaret talbot - silk embroideries rich in detail, using the inspiration of the flushwork patterns on east anglian churches. these are patterns made by alternating flint with

to the 1876 abbey and 1896 chapel buildings. the interiors of each are, for the most part, gutted; work was begun on the buildings, but never completed, due to the subprime mortgage collapse. some significant interior architectural features have been left intact, but the majority of the structures have been stripped down to their frames. the properties are owned by ginsburg development, and their website indicates that they will be developed as \"the abbey at fort hill\", a 12-unit luxury condo complex. this would be to the benefit of the town of peekskill, which sorely needs the tax revenue, but also to the benefit of the community of st. mary - as part of the proposed development, ginsburg would relocate the cemetery to the greenwich location, bringing the founding sisters to the modern convent.next week vedaste is in brussels, so i have 10 days off. i plan to visit the genocide memorials at nyamata and ntarama, which are meant to be harrowing. although i expect it to be a

(muse: katherine\\'s showing her age here!), where you could read a few pages of a story and then, when you reached the place where the hero met the dragon, you could choose between “hero slays dragon” and “dragon eats hero”, flipping to a different page according to your choice to continue reading? with a printed book, this was always a bit clumsy. you had to flip through the pages manually, and on the way you might accidentally see another part of the story. if nothing else, by the time you’d finished flipping back and forth, the book looked grubby and choose-your-own-adventure books had a limited lifespan. with an e-book, however, you could have hyperlinks in the text to do the “flipping” for you, and navigate your way around the story a bit like the hero in a game.“if you know jesus, i am sorry to break it to you, this church (elevation) is not for you.” - steven furtick – confessions of a pastorf.f. bruceday 28roo is exclusively breastfed on a baby-led schedule. we\\'re practicing ecological breastfeeding, not just because it\\'s easy, but to keep my endometriosis symptoms at bay. he spends all his time with his mommy, so we don\\'t need to express milk anymore. his crib is in our bedroom and we also bedshare part of the night.am i getting old?morgen: a couple of years ago (november 2010) i was volunteering at chorleywood literature festival, here in the uk, and watched english tv personality and author peter snow do a talk for over an hour on wellington with no notes, only slides, it was incredible. there’s nothing quite like seeing someone live… i guess a bit like musicians. do you have a favourite of your books or characters?

well, your first contact should be with the gatekeeper since we can get extremely valuable information from him/her such as the target person’s name, who their current carrier is and x-date, among other things. but, now you want to get through the gatekeeper and get to the decision maker, right? so, when do you call? my suggestion is to call anytime the gatekeeper is away from his/her desk which would be during lunch hour, before 9am and after 5pm. generally decision makers will have much longer office hours then their receptionists and you will have a better shot at catching them at that time.at this point, handlers for the event ushered gehry’s interlocutors along.this module contains a sensor which changes output from high to low when a magnetic presence is detected, for example a magnet. the board also has an led which indicates the presence of the magnet to aid in troubleshooting:“magic tree house” is a best-selling children’s book series with over 100 million copies sold worldwide. it tells the story of siblings jack and annie, who discover a magical tree house and with it, embark on adventures of dreams, magic, and thrills.i did give that seeker some tools to reckon with. at the same time, i urged him to absorb and practice a broad array of tools from the teaching, most specially those regarding deprogramming of vices and the use of meditation. to my shock, the seeker was adamant in using them, which made me realize how deeply he was being controlled by the demonic felines.livermore lab was founded to develop the hydrogen bomb, and new weapons of mass destruction are still designed there. for more than 25 years, people of faith and others concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons have gathered on good friday outside the livermore laboratory. this year good friday and earth day coincided.11. took a class in wire wrapping. used one of the rocks i bought in wisconsin..... \"there is also a sensuous and flirtatious aspect to biographical research: breaking seals and confidences, untying ribbons from bundles of documents, raising the dust of strangers\\' lives, dealing and unpacking other people\\'s intimacies, deciphering their photos . . .\"if you paid your bpa dues or got a donation during the student workday, you may get your bpa membership card and pin from me. if you have not paid your dues, please do so before friday, december 16.it\\'s the future.unfortunate events often collaborate, because there is beauty in numbers, i guess.regal marinebut this one kind of takes the cake in my opinion. my friend tara saw this yesterday while driving home from work. actually saw this happen and luckily enough for all of us, took a photo. i\\'m not sure i would have believed her it if she didn\\'t have photo evidence. and now i\\'m pretty jealous that she actually got to see it happen in real life.the drinks and snacks pack includes milk, orange juice, a vitamin drink, a bag of lettuce (i think!), two rice dishes and, from what i gather, a box of fried squid.

( the a-side was \"cousin jane\".) +++with her very serious bat pose lol!when i turned 14, i decided it was time i start learning real things on the piano. no more kid-oriented things that had no musical significance (in essence, or for me). i went to the music store and urged my mother to let me get a big lavender book of frédéric chopin\\'s complete ballades, impromptus & sonatas. i had no idea what a ballade, impromptu, or sonata was, and i can\\'t remember if i even knew who chopin was. i must have, or i wouldn\\'t have been so interested in buying it. i opened the book and could not read a single line, even without being at the piano, but i knew that i must learn something out of it, even if it took me a century, i would do it. i bought it and took it home. i had just gotten a new piano for my birthday, (and i still love the shit out of that piano), so i was anxious to start playing some real music on it. the first piece in the big lavender book was ballade no. 1 in g minor, op. 23. to this day, it is my favorite piece of chopin\\'s music. i cannot find a single fault with it. i was able to play the first page no problem, and would often play it for my mother while she sat outside on the porch because it was just so beautiful. i remember turning the page and deciding to go ahead and tackle the whole thing - who would want to hear just the first page? i learned the second page, the third page, and then on the fourth page i realized that i had probably gotten really over my head. so i skipped pages four and five. six wasn\\'t quite as bad, so i picked that up as well, and while seven was tough i liked to pretend i could get through it. i went through the rest of the thirteen pages like this until i could safely say i \"learned\" this piece, for better or for worse. i played it every day, over and over again. i started at all different places, almost never the beginning, until i memorized virtually every single note in the entire piece (except, of course, pages four and five). i still have journals in which i documented my progress with the piece, writing how badly i want to learn the whole thing, how badly i want to memorize it and play it straight through by myself. i wanted to internalize the piece and be completely consumed by it. i bought a recording of the piece played by ashkenazy or something and would sit with the score in my lap and turn it all the way up. i didn\\'t know the terms with which one would describe the things ashkenazy did with the music, such as rubato and rallentando or a tempo. i just took a pencil and wrote things like \"nothing too fancy at first\" and \"some tone quality, but not full-force\" and... what else... \"bring this out\" and \"play fast\" (i even wrote, literally, \"take time plz\" at one part) and notes saying to sing out the melody as if i were a singer. i was coaching myself to play the piece exactly like the recording. i was reminding a future-version of myself to play as i hoped someday to play. i was so encompassed by the piece, but there was always something missing. i had a few teachers hear me play it, and they never discouraged me but there were definitely some wrong notes that i had learned due to wanting to learn as much as possible over a short period of time. as i grew up, however, and moved to other pieces... i did stop playing it. i stopped opening up my big lavender book, i stopped spending hours on a single piece until my hands screamed for rest. i stopped drilling passages that i thought were simply impossible to be conquered, stopped playing and re-playing sections that my hands were just not large or agile enough to handle. i moved on. aside from some pieces that i do not care for, i barely played any chopin again.i might add, not as part of the review, in light of later events in japanese history, it is a bit chilling to read the authors defense of japanese aggressions in manchuria and korea, especially when they suggest that the japanese annexation of korea in 1910 was for the benefit of the korean people. i think few koreans would agree with that sentiment.i was standing outside my grandfather’s fence near the garden next to the g house where my cousin ce, several other people, and a man who often walks through our neighborhood were;

tonight we’re going to dinner at olive garden – angie’s birthday.i recognize that history changes, rights change, often there are conflicting rights, and one must always do whatever one can to minimize human suffering and seek as equitable a solution as possible (provided of course both sides are prepared to negotiate). ben gurion gave a far better analogy–the analogy of two families claiming the same home. that is closer to reality. many arabs migrated into palestine when jewish immigration created jobs and opportunities. but still, if two people do share a home they can negotiate a settlement and agree to a partition. but what if one side resolutely refuses to partition the house, then claims foul when he is evicted and keeps on trying to climb back in?-gas producing foods such as beans, broccoli, cabbage as they increase intestinal gasfor long we have equated chauvinism with males. after all, we all have been living in a male dominated, patriarchal society for ages. so, male chauvinists were bound to exist in plenty especially since we found women facing obstacles every time they made an attempt to advance in life or tried out something that was slated to be male domain. so, men with conservative views about what women should be or do abounded in plenty. but, are all women the same miserable tortured lot even today? the women, who have waged and won many of their wars with society for equality and rights, do some if not all, stand innocent when it comes to making use of their freedom? are not some women victimizing the very men they accused of being chauvinists?instead, he called. and i emailed. he drove out to see me. i agreed to run sound for the musical he was stage managing. we went to concerts. we watched movies. we held hands. we kissed in the driveway of his ex-girlfriend\\'s house. and at the beach. and in the lake. and at concerts. and at the movies.i hear one of these calling my name!while the busy world nods indulgently, i do just as i please quite really. i get away with it most oftenly, chuckling to myself quite innardly.finally!

(is this kid related to me or what?) i’d had my eye on these browned butter brownies for quite some time, and i was really happy for an excuse to make them with my little buddy.the new features include:what follows is a brief review (sorta a review) of kierkegard’s concluding unscientific postscript. the review, at the very least, underscores why i’ve asserted elsewhere that kierkegaard’s point of view for my work as an author is so vital to understanding his work overall.multiple combati had hoped you\\'d see my face and that you\\'d be remindedso i started brainstorming about some of the biggest things that cause clutter in our lives. and what i discovered was a pretty broad thing.“no,” she said, brushing her bangs out of her eyes, still all nonchalant as she took a seat in front of me. “well, actually, they’re looking for an english-speaking writer in the paris office.” pause. our eyes locked. “i thought of you.” we both started to smile. “on the louis vuitton account,” she finished dramatically.super mario\\'s appointment is far from being a cause for celebration. his alleged deal to pull back from breaking up berlusconi\\'s media holdings is particularly worrying.on a more personal note, i think i can let you know how relieved i am to finally know that i will be leaving singapore for good (main reason is to be with my other half), but they have not decide when i should leave, either november or december. duhhh, i can\\'t wait to receive the official letter soon! and therefore i am still busy settling things here in singapore and managed to complete a quick layout this morning before i go to work. not quite like the whole design but i guess i just need to update my blog. lol. this layout is made for bird is the word {together} challenge.“got a few but one that brings a smile to face is coming back from the stj game earlier in the season & finding out that we where in the quite coach”all i had to do was transcribe his words to have the column verbatim!seek it out and you shall learnthank you again for all of your wonderful suggestions and for taking part in my very special wallpaper giveaway.manufacturer coupon: coupon released by the company that produces a specific product (ex: colgate/palmolive for colgate optic white toothpaste). you may use this in nearly any store. the manufacturer will reimburse said store for the value of the coupon, plus a handling fee (usually $0.08).a very warm and special thanks to friends, who this week, and for weeks past, have come alongside and believed in my ability as a captain, long before i had such faith in myself. and to mrs. mcilmoyle, wherever you may be, for leaving a remark in my grade eleven yearbook that i have never forgotten, and that first encouraged me to continue questioning. thankful to have started, i now seem unable to stop–and for that, i am deeply grateful.1 opening2011 was a year of extremes. from the tragedy of japan’s devastating earthquake and tsunami, to the pageantry of a british royal wedding; from the wave of revolutionary change in egypt, tunisia and libya, to the solemn commemoration that took place on september 11, we reflect on a passing year filled with emotion, knowing the world will never be the same.from the fifties in bags beached by the burn –to add an extra element of fun, we have a variety of 1920s inspired photo booth props for you to pose with: hats, hairstyles, headbands, etc. take a look at a few of the terrific examples visitors made this past sunday!(suggestion list will be posted at the start of the event.)however, french lawyer joseph brehem had rebutted zahid’s statement yesterday, saying that the french courts have jurisdiction over anyone involved in an inquiry.creating a yearbook is great way for a chapter to have a visual recording and documentation of the past year, and can also serve as a recruiting tool for future members. three winning yearbooks will be announced at the june illinois regional convention at harper college in palatine.another law is that the more laws that are created to protect children, the more children will be abused, tortured and killed as a result, especially if it is in florida or california. mickey mouse and the gang definitely fit into all of it. california is really out there when it comes to this. it is beyond debate that california judges, state social workers and other facilitators are engaged in satanic, child abuse rituals and in making sure that children are placed in, or returned to truly terrible conditions, where they can be harmed and tormented for extended periods of time. i have listed very little of what i have come across and using a major search engine will turn up more information than you could read and absorb in a very long time. a few months ago, more or less, there was an article that listed case after case, after case in california, where the courts were returning large numbers of children to abusive situations, when a sane and caring parent was available to receive them. in case after case, the courts returned these children into the hands of monsters, who already had a history of violating them and turned a deaf ear to the good parent; often the parent who had brought it to their attention in the first place and who was backed up by the testimony of the children and corroborating medical evidence.you\\'ll need to download google chrome to watch this interactive film for arcade fire\\'s song \\'we used to wait\\' (that\\'s half the point).my blogging philosophy, motivation, and experience in ten words?????? hmmm....what makes those claims of a coup d’tat by najib and hanif most ridiculous is that both of them ignored the fact that six local pressmen and about 12 photographers and journalists from the foreign media were reportedly assaulted during the fracas on april 28 bersih 3.0 rally by police.with fire with fire, the narrative kept changing. at first i thought we were in a firefighting movie (it’s called fire with fire, it’s about a firefighter, and the first scene is a fire). then it becomes a witness relocation movie. then it becomes a revenge film. then it turns into a gang war film. i’m not saying you can’t change directions in a script. we were just talking yesterday about doing this at the midpoint. but if you keep doing it, the reader starts becoming confused. i know i was. “what kind of movie is this exactly?” i kept asking. you really have to be a great writer to pull this off and while o’connor is a very good writer, i would’ve loved to have seen more focus in this area.clean the place as if the pope were on his way.either way, ben’s face went to “oh fuck” mode and i felt bad for him. i think we’ve all had a thing for the girl who everyone in our lives hoped would maybe fall down some stairs and break her face open. i think we’ve all projected good looks to mean good person. it’s true maybe off camera she is awesome, but unfortunately, abc had a pretty easy time demonizing her. i thought back on it and even the dude wearing the mask last year was more likeable.then, bliss -- the cool air of the lobby of the theater, and a glorious theater it is. an opera house that seats 2,000. i headed for the womens room where i stripped down, spritzed myself with water, and paper towel dried, praying my deodorant was still working. it was -- whew! i mean, miss new jersey with smelly armpits?! but this is probably more than you want to know.everyone in the book is suffering – my wife is unhappy, goes one chapter heading; my daughter’s unhappy, another; my little boy is having difficulties – and we don’t know how miserable they really are, and how much of it is distorted through slocum’s poisoned view. if all first-person narratives seem predominantly to be about the narrator, something happened removes all doubt. slocum’s story is a towering monument to himself. of his wife he says, “i want to be free of her before her health fails. i see an ailing wife in my future.” when his daughter tells him she isn’t happy, “i told her i wasn’t either and nobody had a right to expect to be.” his weakness for honesty is fatal to his family. to his worrisome son (who asks “if you do want to get rid of me, how will you do it?”), he is unable to offer the categoric reassurance he needs. his workplace is not much better (the salesmen are “a vigorous, fun-loving bunch when they are not suffering abdominal cramps or brooding miserably about the future”), though it has its compensations. (“this fiscal period, i am flirting with jane.”)2 red bell peppershope you are all welli was never one to use several different shapes – having 4 or 5 brushes to just apply eye shadow was annoying and time consuming. after i discovered the perfect brush for both applying and blending, i then found a great brush cleaner that not only cleans and sterilizes but dries almost instantly. no more damp brushes – blush, lip, eye shadow, eyebrow, powder, etc. isn’t it amazing how the right product changes an irritant into a pleasure?this top was described as vermilion on the gap website but it seems like a pale orange to me - mandarin, maybe?revolting as it may sound to pronounce such words, what should matter to policy-makers is not is it revolting, but rather is it true. if it was true then, and still is true, then the consequences for euro-american policy-makers are vast. except for the brief disaster known as reconstruction, the great experiment of putting municipal government into the hands of afro-americans is still young. the results thus far have ranged from worrying to calamitous. bringing in ethnically euro managers from the outside to save these cities from themselves may be the only answer, as unhappily this \\'race in its childhood\\' shows time and again that its adulthood lies somewhere in the future.i am grateful for my day job, though, even if i’m less than enthusiastic about it. over the last twelve years it has provided me with a home, a series of cars, paid for my wedding, supported my children and funded my unhealthy relationship with alcohol. and each job i’ve done within the organisation (i have been promoted a number of times, and quite recently, demoted) has been just uninspiring enough to urge me to find an alternative source of satisfaction.the strip strontium dog and lead character johnny alpha are my favourite strip and character in comics, not just in 2000ad. i feel really fortunate that we\\'re allowed to play around with these characters in our sd fanzine dogbreath.do you knit? tell me in the comments below!anyway, a few years later, after the momentous discovery of authenticity, i found myself with a small mountain of pretty, but useless, frocks. mum kept a couple (i am kicking myself not not getting pics of them too when i was over there this morning) and the rest i ripped the embroidery off and clagged them onto a green wool tunic for my stepdad, peter, figuring that since they do the odd village fete, etc, where some kind of half hearted attempt at costume is required, he could make use of it. someone might as well.atos are the french it firm responsible for carrying out the government’s work capability assessment which has led to tens of thousands of sick and disabled people being forced into poverty after being stripped of essential benefits. despite the process being dubbed unfit for purpose and an increasing number of suicides due to the stressful and vicious health testing regime, this form of assessment is to be extended to everyone on some form of disability or health related benefit.downing was killed in an 1852 fire on a hudson river steamboat and vaux took over the firm, moving it to new york city from newburgh, ny. in 1865, he and olmsted formed olmsted, vaux and company and were pioneers in landscape architecture, creating parks in cities across the country.dinner: wrap; 2 oz turkey, 1 slice american cheese, 1/4 avocado, 1 wrap, 1 cup sliced strawberriesit’s all about tradition. concepts such as marriage and the like are almost as old as society and civilised living itself. to modernise them after they’ve been the same (or at least similar) for so long would be to break with years, decades, centuries of tradition.- make physical plans – stay healthyten years ago, i called for people who will be my covenant partners; and several people volunteered. i said it would be for ten years, the ten years are over now and many of them had asked, what’s happening, are we going to continue? i told them i will ask god.at this point, matt decided that this conversation was too ridiculous to continue and abruptly cut me off, citing the fact that he had to get up in 9 hours as the reason why he was hanging up. pfft…lame excuse, matt. i don’t buy it. it is possible to get by with only 9 hours of sleep, even though i do recommend a full 12. i mean, you do have to keep up your strength for the next workout session which will be filled with tears, regret, exhaustion, and probably broken knee caps…and, for me, that’s just the warm-up.the goddess of luck (spelled lakṣmī, but pronounced almost exactly like “luck-shh.me”) is fickle. luck never stays with any one person forever. but she herself always and forever stays at the feet of the all-attractive. that is a testament to the ever newer and newer beauty, fascination and charm of śrī kṛṣṇa.melodious note,and i love my new camera! there could be better ones, but this one works for me.hermione at the yule ballof king james and uncle sami\\'m not saying i haven\\'t encountered my fair share of men. i\\'ve met plenty of mr. oh-so-wrongs, mr. hell nos, mr. way out of my leagues and mr. ha-ha, yeah rights. and let\\'s not forget loser ex-boyfriend (a.k.a. mr. what-the-hell-were-you-thinking, moron?).movie special effects were not a problem in the philippines back in 1965 when von serna (snooky’s dad!) appeared as “lastik man”—yes! plastic man, without the “p”– 40 years before hollywood’s mr. fantastic.compared to many uk author solution companies, these prices are pretty competitive and only just marginally above lightning source’s prices. the math alone already suggests that the grosvenor author is doing well on the royalty front.the wife thought about this statement for a split second….the other insight i got from that paper was that students don\\'t really understand measurement uncertainty. i definitely find that to be true. i like geoff\\'s approach but i don\\'t really do anything about this other than hate how i don\\'t do anything about it.it’s another piece of advice i’m giving out to the world that i should be following myself. i stopped writing a while ago (december?

who wants to be reminded of death? for mattie it wasn\\'t so much the problem of death and begin dead but waiting to die. she had made all of her life time mistakes and had her days, she was ready for it to finally just be done with it and often her heart made a troubling stab at her chest and she new her time wasn\\'t long. the part of her life constructed in mistake and loneliness finally would be wiped away and perhaps she would go to sleep and wake up with greta as pretty as the day they met. often mattie just woke a littleshould i buy it? absolutely. if it prevents even one person from hogging the cutting table while fretting over eighteen bolts of fabric, trying to pick the one that could replace the only moda fabric the store doesn’t have in stock, it will have done its job admirably. and yes, i’m talking about you, dear.of course the hubby is none to thrilled with my decision to keep my last name. i know how important it is to him for me to change it. every so often i think about changing it to surprise him.a voice cries loud as she sings her word.conceding the plausibility of this, isn\\'t it also true that no total exception exists? no decision made in a vacuum of institutional legal order could be in any way effective. there is a lot of law below the level of the constitution or even statutory law -- army and police codes and rules about chain of command, quite significantly -- that need to be depended on especially in a state of exception. so the decision itself always requires a residue of the norm to be put into effect. since, moreover, the cooperation of these institutions is also a matter of decisions made in the chain of command, this also shows that the decision is not unitary. and all this is to say nothing of the place of informal norms about the conduct in politics which do much to determine the actual paths of events in cases where the law is not explicit.control of the government passed to the african national congress (anc), which was fighting a revolutionary war for much of the century. since then, south africa has been ruled by the anc, and year by year the anc comes more and more to resemble the former apartheid regime.whew. :)in darkness, still, i do reclinecan you believe that we are already past the middle of april?! at first glance, this cinco de mayo post seems awfully early, but may 5th is two short weeks from saturday! a few years ago, when our oldest was too young for official preschool, i taught a cinco de mayo lesson in our little, four-kiddo preschool co-op. the little ones loved all of the activities, and the cinco de mayo lesson post on my old blog is to this day the most popular post.vincent dug into the memory hole, his own sentiments and some events that stick with him from the glory days, a couple of which we used in gt backed with some killer unseen photos including a rare photo shoot which were never released to the public. so with his help, gt was able to yet again bring more ultra-rare photos to the table. things are no different here either - as we bring you images and sentiments we were unable to use in glorious times.i believe that these terrible upheavals are omens that the earth, who bore the beautiful footprints of the all-attractive, is now dispossessed and her fortune destroyed.juggling was a sideline for us. we would have loved to do it full time, but my father wisely chose the security of a regular daytime job. his career was as an accountant for an industrial contractor. and though he juggled books for a regular paycheck, his true passion was juggling objects.every year over the fourth of july we go to wayne county and stay in my uncle\\'s cabin in grover. this year our weekend was filled with a lot of the usual traditions, such as : fishing, four wheeling, parade, eating, shooting, arrowhead hunting, and of course eating some more. it was so much fun as always. this year, jeff and i decided to go to the dance at the big apple in torrey. the big apple is an outside facility where wayne county holds thier dances and other festivities. there was a live band, and they were actually really good. they played a lot of chris ledoux, tom petty, and pretty much just about everything there is. jeff and i danced until our legs wouldn\\'t dance anymore... and when our legs wouldn\\'t dance anymore, we sat and watched all the interesting things there was to see around us. with the dance being in torrey, there is a good mix of cowboys and tree-hugging hippies. ill just put it this way, it made for an entertaining night of very interesting dance styles. ha ha. jeff and i have already decided that we are going every year.i really need to set our computers up closer together.i recall standing behind my father as he knelt by the bottom door freezer and thought “oh my poor poor parents–don’t they know? just because it died from the heat, the freezer cannot bring it back!”my guess is that he smokes a decent amount of pot each day. i don\\'t even know what a decent amount of pot is. a teaspoon? a ziplock bag full? i\\'m exaggerating but you get my point. i\\'m clueless. often when he comes by, he has \"high\" eyes.the council’s special helplinea decorated veteran of world war i, hitler joined the german workers\\' party, precursor of the nazi party, in 1919, and became leader of the nsdap in 1921. in 1923 he attempted a coup d\\'état, known as the beer hall putsch, in munich. the failed coup resulted in hitler\\'s imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, mein kampf (my struggle). after his release in 1924, hitler gained popular support by attacking the treaty of versailles and promoting pan-germanism, antisemitism, and anticommunism with charismatic oratory and nazi propaganda. after his appointment as chancellor in 1933, he transformed the weimar republic into the third reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of nazism. his aim was to establish a new order of absolute nazi german hegemony in continental europe.best of all, a couple of more brain ideas regarding concepts and detailing came to mind. pun intended. stay tuned!here is today\\'s update from the info site:the universal hatred of the apartheid regime in white south africa has blinded us to the reality of the acts of murder, torture and terrorism committed by the spear of the nation, which mandela and his colleagues presided over in their leadership of the anc. this helps to explain why, until the beginning of july 2008, mandela was still on the us list of terrorists.designers this weekend at the business of design tastemaker sale - eleish van breems, suzanne kasler, tara shaw and suzanne tucker. rhonda and i caught up with keith this morning as the sale celebrating his new book is in play to find out what pieces he personally can\\'t resist. here are keith\\'s picks:oh, friends.i got messed on my gre study guides since they changed the whole format of the test right after i took it. . . too bad–that could have been an extra $20 (for 5 large books)!

during the other 23 hours of the day, i\\'ve been reading... one book after the next. i\\'ve found myself reading auto biographies like the glass castle, angela\\'s ashes, and the hiding place. while some people might find this kind of reading depressing, i find it cathartic. it\\'s nice to be reminded there are other people out there who have seen worse... much worse.have to have pay day loans – here i will discuss things to knowwhat do you mean? (internally giggles.)there are many ways that this question could have been answered, ranging from the politically correct through to the honest and commonsense. the fact that the staff at the school felt it appropriate to drag the boy\\'s poor mother into school and attempt to force her to sign a form condemning her son for an alleged thought-crime is a damning indictment indeed of these so-called teachers. those responsible should hang their heads in shame and be thrown out of the school and banned from ever working with children again. politically correct indoctrination is a form of child abuse and those who practice it should be treated accordingly.rickey was crossing a street when he was 13, and saw a man who had been killed while he stumbled across the street in a drunken stupor, shrouded by a blood-stained sheet, surrounded by police and onlookers. as he craned his neck to see better, his mother pulled him away, saying “you don’t need to see that”. when he got home, he found out on the evening news that the man was his father. rickey’s mother had asked his father’s boss, a few years before, to give her the checks, since her husband was drinking away all the money. he complied, and eventually the two of them moved in together, breaking up his marriage. when rickey’s mother later moved to an apartment, then moved out again, rickey stayed put, got a job at age 16, and encouraged his girlfriend to move in with him. the landlord said he was a christian and did not want rickey living with a girl he was not married to, so rickey asked her to marry him, and they began life together. he was initially touched and influenced by his praying, church-going mother-in-law, who was part of an intact and loving family. it was only a few months, however, before rickey’s in-laws’ family crumbled as his wife’s mother moved out with another woman. this was to be the pattern set in rickey’s life: when he was influenced by the gospel, the failures of men tore his faith down again.i picked him up and we went into the other room together, away from the dump trucks and crayons that were pissing him off so badly.

introduction to the genre. i love writing flash, partly for the challenge of conveying a story in the absolute minimum of words but mainly because i’m too harsh an editor of my short stories and what was once 1000 words becomes 250! there are some fantastic writers taking part including quite a few twitter friends. i don’t think this is a coincidence – if you have to make a concise point in 140

out a handful of fine pictures, including kiss me deadly and vera cruz. that year he turned his hand to the war movie and came up with the superior and intense attack. this came at a time when the war film was transitioning from the flag-waving efforts of the forties to more bitter and realistic portrayals of combat.greg x. volz had been the amazing vocalist with petra, the group that had first

that the 190 million acres of boreal forest in ontario and quebec will eventually be made off-limits. last year, 21 of canada’s largest logging companies and nine conservation groups proposed the canadian boreal forest agreement to support the protection of more than seventy million acres.that spring a wonderful thing happen. the old woman\\'s tea bushes grew lush and tender leaves. the tea

to attend church with her. she went to a big, impressive southern baptist church that had just opened a cool new family activity center that had a gym, an indoor running track, classrooms, etc. other friends of ours attended this church, and so i thought nothing of it when i agreed to accompany her family to a few worship services. since my family didn\\'t \"do\" church, the only way i was going to go to church at all was going to be by tagging along with another family who did.it’s like dr. strangelove. “we’ll hide in our tunnels with our young ladies while everybody else up on the surface

been put away because of some slag and you take to twitter to vent your frustration. you see someone else openly abusing her, so you do it too. you see people saying that any other lad would do the same – that they would do the same. confirmation bias enters in – these are people who agree with you that this guy was stitched up by some silly bitch who can’t handle her drink, ‘yeah’, you think, ‘who wouldn’t do the same, silly whore’, and you join in. #justiceforched you type. then some of your new found compatriots start naming her and you are so caught up in this whirlpool that you do it

look nice at the same time as ‘going like stink’ and maybe mclaren are the team, so far, that have managed this but given a choice between a pretty car or one that is going to go faster, as a f1 fan, i would want the faster car! if this style of nose helps ferrari, force india and caterham to improve their chances within the race then ‘bring on the ugly noses’ is what i say!i\\'m wondering what our friends and family are going to say when they hear about this crazy plan. no more trips to the grocery store? well, yes, we\\'ll still need dog food and toilet paper and toothpaste, so yes, we

actually passes \\'ownership\\' of the baby to the local authority and that, that alone, allows the \\'local authority\\' staff/officers and the courts to take the child away from the parents if they ever wanted to do that. this applies until the child reaches the \\'age of maturity\\' set by the current legal \\'statutes\\'. doing that is not \\'lawful\\' but after the birth has been registered, it is \\'legal\\' and there is a world of difference between those two terms, a difference which it is very important thatas we walked back towards the agricultural shed where we store our machinery,

tightwad tuesday is a tip we\\'ve all have heard before. don\\'t toss out those leftovers! find a way to use them up. luckily for me, hubz came from a family of leftover eaters. we don\\'t have much

throughout the day and still manage to be off. they predicted snow yesterday, but said there would be little to no new accumulation. i\\'d say there were a good 4 inches of snow piled up out there during the day and it was still snowing hard when we went to bed. the forecast (which, of course, may or may not be accurate) is also calling for another 2-4 inches of accumulation tonight. i\\'m hoping that the chance of rain and above freezing temperatures predicted for later in the week don\\'t pan out. i\\'d really like to spend christmas day building a snowman and sledding.glass of wine as we had a bit of time to kill before dinner. we sat outside and listened as a rather posh, and tiddly, lady chatted with a friend; we learnt that she was cooking a roast at noon the next day and

cocktails down her throat. rather her than me!“ya, and she’s also very pretty.”here’s what we’re going to do.this was the picture in front of our house a week ago. the storm had passed and sunday

they are trying to fix it before high season starts in june 2011.the final bit of important info we get from this episode is the other story about those who got spirited away. apparently their school was built over a shrine, and as a result, the school was “cursed”. the girl who vanished (whom they perceive to be yuuko) was in theory, a victim of the school’s curse. coincidentally, the place where yuuko’s remains are situated, looks eerily like a shrine. teiichi notices the interrelation of the stories (the mystery behind the mirror, the ghost that takes students away, and now the shrine mystery) presents the idea that the “mysteries” and ghost stories could all possibly be cover-ups for some greater mystery – most likely the truth of what really happened to yuuko.so why am i hoping

india is still less than 15 per cent. these figures show significant disparities across class, caste, gender and region. it is also less than the world average of 23 per cent. secondly, despite the government’s constant pledge to raise public spending in education to at least 6 per cent of the gross domestic product (gdp), public spending on education still remains at less than 4 per cent of gdp. this is much lower than the share in a number of developing countries. the average share of higher education in the total education expenditure of both central and state governments has come down from 14 percent during 1981-82 to 1991-92 to 12.7 percent during 1992-93 to 2003-04.that’s right, “titanic ii” will be a 21st-century, historically accurate replica of the original titanic and is set

of a amorous proclivity for farm animals, it\\'s the confession that i play the clarinet. in the early 1960s, it seems, the clarinet, easily portable and more abundant than tympani or sousaphone, was the instrument of choice for families who had children in los angeles county schools. there were three sections of clarinets in band--adding up to more than 20 musicians--compared with the random bassoonist or trio of euphonium players. for a boy who measured his entire life on being mentally and bodily different from his fellows, the clarinet promised little more than anonymity and an opportunity to create screeching sounds that would scare off all sentient creatures with ears.after three years in the industry, this was my first field visit, and a dream come true. i will finally be

can assume that you are intuiting all kinds of things and ascribe to them tremendous significance, when actually they are just the voice of the individual and collective ego. unless we get over our ego-driven narcissism, the whole notion of intuition can become very tangled up with our already over-exaggerated sense of self-importance and with all the excessive significance we tend to give to our feelings and our personal story. if we’re not awake to this, we can easily end up deluding ourselves and misleading others with our so-called spiritual intuitions.- a signed paperback copy of

in the chambers of commerce and in the upmarket cafes of kolkata. some of this is the upwardly mobile upper middle class with its ‘consumer product’ centric view of all things. then there is the element of supposed ‘coolness’ of ‘bengal’ vis-à-vis the vernacular. whats more, it even reeks of the nostalgia of stolen burma teak, lazy colonial evenings and a booming calcutta port to drain away surplus. the over bearing presence of the calcutta-centric ( not kolkata-centric) discourse on the question of renaming west bengal did serve to skew the public. to some inhabitants of calcutta, whose ‘bengal’ or ‘west bengal’ do not stretch beyond the confines of the metropolis (except a flight to darjeeling). they are very perturbed about the discomfiture that foreigners (read inhabitants of western europe and usa) would endure pronounce this new name. if they had half the empathy for their fellow beings just beyond their city compared to what they have for folks who live half a world away, may be they would have better appreciated the importance of ‘west’ in ‘west bengal’. their lived reality remains utterly divorced from the sensitivities of the matuas and other low-caste communities who migrated from east bengal and have trans-border organic connections in terms of family ties and pilgrimages. slicing off references to ‘west’ would have been a project of cleavage – especially ironic in the face of officially sanctioned joint-exercises ( the drill-sounding expression is used intentionally) between india and bangladesh using rabindranath thakur’s 150th birth anniversary as the reason.this, at the same time when, poor bengalis in either bengal, are continuously harassed and belittled by immigration functionaries and east bengalis are gunned down at the indian republican frontier by government of india’s border security force at a disturbingly regular interval.that the killing of east bengalis does not evoke any serious reaction in kolkata, the capital of west bengal, might suggest that the time has indeed come to drop the ‘west’ in west bengal, as its mandarins show not a shred of sympathy to its brothers and sisters to the east. but there may be hope still.the commission held the claim invalid because \"said zinc anode\" did not have an antecedent basis, because the term \"zinc anode\" does not appear in the claim prior to the term

with a positive, and immediately follow the criticism with another positive, the blow will be much easier to hear and digest. the listener won’t be so eager to defend him/herself and their work, but

the recipe, and to make it a bit decorative added the pecan halves to the top. also, since i usually have dark brown sugar in the cupboard i used that instead of the light brown sugar the original

never so popular. but here in north america, it wouldn’t work. i’m sorry janus. and, truth be told, i wouldn’t suggest it for girls either. it’s too close to janice, which isn’t vintage enough yet

your expectations, hopes and dreams for your children away from specific “head” topics – college, degree, marriage, money – and into looser “heart” ones, like happiness, peace, love, and passion. because our expectations manifest themselves in ways that are visible to our children, “head” expectations are likely to push them down the path toward pre-defined traditional education choices and careers, with fewer opportunities for radically different choices. but “heart” expectations can take many guises. these types of expectations could lead them to college and corporate career, to be sure; but it is far more likely that this would be a path of their choosing as opposed to a path of convenience. it could also lead them to travel the world. it could lead them to a quiet career in the arts, or an “out loud” life doing things that we – and they – cannot even imagine yet. in other words, it can help them view their lives as ones of freedom and choice in which success is defined on their own terms and in their own time. it can help them see what it possible, rather than what is impossible or pre-ordained. and it can help them see that success when defined by the heart is more lasting and joyful than when defined by the head.i wonder if it is ok with these expert-types if i\\'m dependent on anyone at all. is it ok that i depend on my husband for companionship, financial

0.6% increase from 2007. the slowdown is largely explained by a substantial drop in grants at the patent offices of the republic of korea (-32.5%). without the substantial growth of grants in china,

me feel creative, not to mention crave more education!my good times are fading again. i don’t want the good feelings to go.at any rate, as i said, i’m almost impressed by how quickly several different media outlets zeroed in on this single word and made it forever toxic. besides, as paul slansky’s idiots, hypocrites, demagogues, and more idiots tells, the scariest connotation this campaign slogan

am glad that his manner of leaving office suggests that the pugnacious character he often chose to portray is not, as i always believed, the only sarkozy but rather a persona that he believed, rightly or wrongly, to be politically effective.much to my dismay we found it wasn\\'t treasure buried under the dirt, just a concrete slab, preventing us from planting flowers in ground here. i suppose the

on a number of opportunities just so i wouldn’t be a bother. last semester, i stood face-to-face with southern-rock god and influential storyteller, mike cooley from the drive-by truckers. he was wandering around downtown tuscaloosa before dbt’s show back in september of last year. i was standing outside rooster’s blues house with my manager, scott, handing out flyers to passer-bys when cooley walked up. there i was, all googly-eyed and unable to utter a sound except for a barely audible “hi.” i stared and smiled as he talked with scott about the night’s show (see, rooster’s hosted the dbt show at the bama theatre. i felt honored). eventually, cooley heads off and i wave goodbye, regretting my inability to ask for his autograph. scott didn’t even realize who he had been talking to for the past three minutes. of course i made sure to fill him in, including my confession of obsession. i’m still mad at myself to this day. i didn’t look cool. i just looked crazy.the number one market for all this crap jewelery seemed to be middle-aged women from luzon. every single one of them were covered head to toe in metric shit tons of cheap sparkly chinese bling like a protective exoskeleton of awesome sparkly over tight, black, fetishy clothes. like the officers\\' uniform of a disco spy unit, or really short extras from the road warrior. i have no idea what this is about, but it was a welcome treat for the eyes. other than them, the people watching was kind of dismal, unless you had some kind of weird interest in old white people, which i do not.simply take a banana (peel intact)

onthe apartment building was another upscale one, under lock and key. we got buzzed in and entered the compound. it is one of those places that strives to be modern in its appearance. i don’t like it. it tried to hard to be modern and in the atempt it looked tacky and had a cold, impersonal feeling. large walls baracaded the residents into a secluded world of unnecessary beams, odd architecure that did not serve any purpose and lonely, impersonal doors that led to the apartment/compartments that housed people’s esxistence. no one has yards, everyone is boxed into their secluded place and your entire life may go unkown to an outsider until someone comes by to collect your junk. i don’t like the place.i\\'ve been having the strangest dreams lately! last night i was making parrots on a hot

seen and she assured me that life in that house was simply unbearable on account of that same old lady. she said an old woman, the exact counterpart of the one i described, had owned the house years ago and had been murdered by her son-in-law, who secured a large sum of money that she had secreted in the house. he burned her body in the cellar and it had lain there for years until the bones were finally discovered by some men digging in the cellar. as the family were all dead nothing could be done toward bringing the murderer to justice. ever since the discovery of the bones the house had been haunted by the woman’s ghost. doors were slammed and opened, locks were unlocked, windows were rattled and unearthly groans heard. she said she had moved into the house only five days before, but, although she had paid a month’s rent in advance, she would lose that and move out.\"so some days are good. and then, often without warning, some days are bad. today hit me like a truck. one

attacking or if it\\'s all just bluster that he knows, by itself, isn\\'t going to win anyone over. if it\\'s the latter, he\\'s going to have to try to sell it psychologically--creating a sense of intimacy, softening you up, creating a sense of us against them, making you think he\\'s your new best friend. scaring the bejesus out of you with dire predictions of global catastrophic doom (he

europe so we should be leading the way in contact centre job design and services - especially as we are not selling products but are delivering vital services to some of the most vulnerable people in society. instead our management are trailing behind with their archaic obsession with targets and pressurising our members. they just look at quantitative targets on numbers of calls answered and the length of time we spend on each call, which is constantly being reduced to impossible levels. our members recognise clearly that the public, when they get through to us on the phone, want their query dealt with. people do not want to be fobbed off nor have to wait up to 3 hours for one of our hard-pressed benefit processing colleagues to ring them back.when you\\'re putting together a story,

over a ceramic white compote to extend the height of our teakettle.the ‘as’ here has particular meaning (as opposed to using the word ‘in’). as implies a ‘way of life’, a ‘point of view’, it implies action on the part of the person living the life. it implies there is a indistinguishable relationship between the person living the life and the life that is being lived – they mutually create and shape one another. if we used the word ‘in’, then it implies that where one lives is independent of the person living the life – like some independent place that exists from its own side. that is a false conception of things.so how should christians think about judging? first, we must ask what one means by “judge.” the dictionary distinguishes several definitions. to judge can mean to pass legal

church and greenwich. these streets must be designed to accommodate both vehicular and pedestrian use. the public realm in new york is primarily composed of streets and sidewalks. as such, dey and cortlandt provide key opportunities to expand the amount of open space and accessibility into the site. furthermore, these streets will ensure that the typical block size along church street remains the same as the blocks to the north and south. in new york, with few exceptions, larger block sizes (for example, blocks as long as the dimension between liberty and dey streets) are provided only for our most significant public buildings such as grand central station.“stray cat blues” is a deliciously sleazy song, crawling with decadence and sexual debauchery. it’s about a rock musician who has sex with an admittedly underage groupie, and considers it “no hanging matter” and “no capital crime.” it’s spoken in the second person from the rock star to the girl. now, it’s not a story of the two having sex, and then the rock star finding out after the fact that the girl lied about her age, the rocker regretful that he’s landed in jail. the fact that the girl is only 15 is out in the open. it ups the sleaze to about five times its normal amount.but show me where in the bible it says that a person can\\'t have a drink? and where it says that if you do have a drink--you suddenly can\\'t pray

to conquer k2. the book is a thrilling and spine-chilling account of what happened when a collection of teams tried to conquer the second tallest mountain in the world. what made the account especially poignant for me was remembering the press coverage at the time about gerard mcdonnell, the first irishman to climb to the top of k2. in this book he is presented as an irishman to be proud of, with great humour and generosity and the ability to get on with people from all backgrounds.incentive? i doubt it. i guess for good or ill, garrett is forever bound to this project. and i hear

no wonder i\\'ve been pulling away. not wanting to hear completely unnecessary (and frankly very offensive) commiserations. not wanting to hear ignorant comments about the perceived nature of all children with down as if they are completely ruled and determined by this one extra chromosome and not in the least the 46 others. not wanting to hear one more time how especially courageous we are, when courage has nothing to do with having a child with down and everything to do with just having a child. not wanting to explain time and time again how our daughter will have a full range of emotions from that humongo-tantrum-enraging anger to giddy happy hysterics (if she\\'s anything like me that will be the scale), the ability to learn and develop like any other child (even if that development will happen somewhat more slowly in her case), and a bright future ahead of her with friends, education, coffee, jobs, boyfriends (or girlfriends should she be so inclined), and all that which comes with growing up. and most of all, not wanting to justify my joy and happiness for this, the approaching birth of my first child, my daughter, who i thought had already disappeared from my deck of cards, nor justify my deepest desire for her to pull through the misery the placenta is currently being held responsible for and arrive here safely, just the way she is.another example: say for instance the biggest fear of a black government is a white right-wing backlash. what do they need to do? plant a few bombs in black areas; blame it on a right-wing organization (that you created)

which is appropriate for saturday because that\\'s what i do each saturday on tossing it out. on this blog on saturdays i look at where i\\'ve been in the previous week and where i am expecting to go in the week to come. it\\'s kind of a nice approach because it gives readers a chance to go back to look at something they\\'ve missed and lets them know if there is something they might like to

palin’s “despicable” ad. i even got into an argument with more than one liberal facebook friend over the inoffensive (to most sentient human beings) ad. one of them even insisted palin should be arrested. amused, i responded: arrested for what? because of liberal politicians you support, we can’t even profile at the airport or engage in “warrantless wiretapping” or engage in any other

we all know that a renegade spider loose in the bedroom may be the only thing worse than one loose in the bathroom. i quickly took my eyes from the enemy just long enough to perform a sweeping search of the available weaponry, and i found a small pile of ponytail holders in reach. aha!the wind was gusting like it hadmugabe\\'s and mswati\\'s authoritarian actions bear striking similarities, both:-you see, it goes both ways. women are scrutinized for being too heavy, but they’re also scrutinized for being too thin. i’m proud of all of the “embrace your curves” movements going on out there, but too often those images of beautiful, curvy women are next to images of very thin women with a caption that says something to the effect of ”i’d rather be curvy than look anorexic.” granted, many of those pictures show a thin woman that looks obviously unhealthy, and i know it’s meant to comment on the pressure women are under to be dangerously thin, but is that actually the message that comes across? to me, it says that you love your body, but … what? “ew, that skinny girl is gross?”to-date i can find no marriage, death or census records for him in any of these three countries!i hope you enjoyed this snapshot of this wonderful world of tsm (and proof of my propensity for subtitles). regular contributor lex kahn has also celebrated the anniversary with his wednesday word of the week and michael will weigh in as the editor-in-chief. it’s been a fun, informative, and engaging year participating in the blog and watching it grow. i look forward to seeing what the next year brings. big thanks to my wonderful husband for making me a part of his online world, too.not all the ground is well-trod, either. conquest is, for example, the only méliès film i’ve seen with a subplot: in this case involving a group of suffragettes (played, without sympathy, by burly women) who demand to join the trip. méliès also tinkers with his dramatic structure, allowing his lead aeronaut, professor crazyloft, to treat his guests, and us, to a demonstration of how the craft will fly, using a scale model. (in keeping with méliès’ dubious commitment to physics, this demo justifies nothing we’ll see later on, but it does make certain scenes more logical.) he also films one of conquest’s automobile sequences outdoors--rare for this director--though the car is repainted to match méliès’ cartooned hyper-reality. there’s even a brief closeup, late in the film.“exactly. and then if a campaign should finally catch fire and start exploding on you, all of a sudden you start to condescend and rip into us for lack of decorum. decorum. hah!” matt laughed loudly. heads turned. “on the one hand, you want democracy to be a great popular sport, everybody involved and cheering wildly. but as soon as it starts to happen, you’re horrified. it’s like you want everybody to come to the party but only if they dress just so. you complain about how nobody votes anymore. big deal! ninety percent of the people in italy vote. you want a country like that? and all this bs about how television ads are ruining campaigns! you know why editorial writers don’t like television spots? because they take power out of their hands! they want a few dinky debates, a polite campaign, and then for everybody to sit at home on sunday waiting for the editorials to know which way to vote. instead, some jerk like me can muck things up! you want twenty percent of the people to vote instead of fifty! just take campaign commercials off the air. you’ll bore everybody to death!”if the british public ever paused to take notice of anything other than the x-factor, this week’s soap operas or the latest developments in the unappetising saga of tiger and the three skanks, (update: make that eleven skanks) they might notice that some very troubling events are taking place amongst our allies across the channel, and indeed elsewhere.they have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.i love the bright white in here! it really helps to lighten up the room and is a great contrast to the dark table and chairs. if you read my previous post about painting the sideboard, i had decided to paint it blue. well, after 4 coats of blue paint (2 different shades) i lived with it for a couple of days and decided to just prime it and paint it white. that way i can use it in different rooms if i decide to, and i am not stuck with a specific color scheme in the dining room.so today, i thought i would try to cheer you up a little.buy now! it’s on sale! they won’t have it again!so, if you would like to be considered for a spot on our team for may, please leave a link to your blog below. the link will close tuesday and i will announce the two may gdt members on wednesday.i was alone with no friends, and had a job that was promising for the future but didn\\'t make ends meet. i had never been single for a long period of time, and had never supported myself without financial help from school loans or someone to share the bills with.1 tbsp of chopped nutsand the beer will more than likely be vb or carlton draught. many were already onto their second or third pony of the stuff at the rsl bar by the time we got back to our car. it will be significant to them. it will mean something. and here’s the thing; for all the discussion and debate and sometimes anger over what many see as a glib or opportunistic promotion by cub to ‘cash in’ on anzac day with their ‘raise a glass’ appeal and the money it donates to returned and services leagues around the country, it means something.ms sabbith said the best thing to help homeless people was to build shower and toilet facilities around the city, east point, and near the hospital.i finally got myself to sit down and watch cujo after having the disc for over a week and a half. for some reason i just could never convince myself to watch it. i’m not sure if it’s because i’d seen it before, or if i’m just tired of “old” movies, or if i wasn’t looking forward to watching another movie with a little kid as one of the main characters, or some other reason altogether. whatever it was, there was definitely some kind of mental block that was just making me not want to watch it. part of it may be that, since i’m still only halfway through danse macabre, and the next book i’m reading also doesn’t have a movie associated with it, there just wasn’t any sense of urgency involved.356 **10. “shakespeare’s falstaff: a socratic survey,” greek star, chicago, illinois, december 12, 2002, p. 5, december 19, 2002, p. 10.

and give me very creepy looks. this was done by all the men, not one. i thought it was strange, but i dismissed their looks. i began to notice that anytime anything happened at work, it was always my

looking pretty good. as they see it, the current nature of our networks and our technologies means “…for the first time in history, our capabilities have begun to catch up to our ambitions.” they do make it clear how today’s technologies are so different. in several clear, convincing chapters they explain the nature of exponential and combinatorial technologies and the ways in which they can spread and change. it is not just the presence of our current technologies, but the ways in which they lay the groundwork for future technologies, that makes this moment so important.now the economic outlook is shifting, despite modest gains over the years lesotho remains one of the world’s poorest countries. the 2011/12 budget was “the most difficult the government had to put together,” reckons

he is stubborn. he asked me why we couldn’t use the front entrance. i did not say it was because i am also stubborn. i just told him i didn’t know how to use the front entrance. it sounded lame to me, too. we went in the front entrance and paid for our admission without issue. then, we looked around. we asked an attendant where we were supposed to go. she said the various rooms were full. that was

(for a complete list of my upcoming presentations, please click here!) my first thought was, “uh... why would i want to teach about stem cells in kindergarten?” and then my next question was, “what is stem?” (unfortunately, this only revealed my own ignorance in the subject, lol!) for those of you that are still in the dark regarding this topic like i was, the term “stem” in relation to edu-speak refers to projects that integrate all four of these subjects: science, technology, engineering, and math. hence the term, stem! so for the purpose of this blog post, this discussion has nothing to do with stem cells at all, thankfully! and as far as the “engineering” part of it is concerned, all the children have to do is simply build something. so..., in this project, they would need to use the scientific method, and perhaps hypothesize, predict, conclude, etc. they would need to use technology in it somehow, such as a camera, ipad, document camera, etc. they would need to build something, or try to “invent” something. and then they would need to use their math skills somehow, by counting, estimating, sorting, dividing (sharing equally), etc. according to sde, there is grant money out there for teachers that create stem projects! hmm, very interesting!!! now i just need to figure out where to apply for it!!!!we communicate often. if he bumps his fingers, or isn\\'t feeling well, or for whatever reason throws a tantrum to shame most well versed three year olds - she lets me know.@windaddict\\'s/@hopsafari declared this dish to be his favorite dessert of all time. this is chef philip\\'s take on the wendy\\'s frosty with fries. it isn\\'t a secret that i\\'m a lover of the wendy\\'s frosty, and this dessert really knocks it out of the park. a french fry cream borders the outside of the dish that is topped with a variety of sweet soils. on top of that is a aerated and dehydrated chocolate shake topped with a creamy sorbet. many of chef philip\\'s desserts require that you eat all of the components together. when you eat each one of these components together, you\\'ll get a time warp back to your childhood of fries in ice cream. you might even be doing it as an adult. have no shame. chef philip doesn\\'t.mandy :)oil/ghee – 1+1 teaspoons105. “there are two ways to spread happiness; either be the light who shines it or be the mirror who reflects it.” – edith whartonplease make sure you leave a comment for each entry...that would be super fantastic! because of holidays and whatnot, i am taking entries through december 29 (thursday folks!) and will be announcing my two winners on the 30th! thanks for all of your interest and support and good luck!!

to store in the freezer and pull out and reheat and serve. there are two ways to try. the first is to press the meatloaf mixture into a muffin pan. bake time is reduced to 25 minutes but be sure the internal temp is 160° f. the other method is to use a larger pan then divide your raw mixture in a grid separating into mini meat loaf portions. bake time is also reduced for this method. just search

loneliest planet, at least in as much as they\\'re both about couples walking in the wilderness. but while the loneliest planet featured a recently engaged couple with a love that gets tested, leave me like you found me features a couple that has broken up before and is (for some reason) trying to get back together. what it illustrates better than anything is why they broke up--they had gotten to the point where they knew how to push all of each other\\'s buttons, but didn\\'t have the willpower to refrain from doing so. well, they still don\\'t, but they\\'re still attracted to each other. so they go on a camping trip in sequoia national park, where they alternately fuck and fight in the woods--sometimes within minutes of each. it\\'s very well made, the two leads (megan boone and david nordstrom) do a fine job, and it\\'s a believable portrait of a possible resurrection of a relationship that maybe should stay dead. but pretty quickly into it i kind of stopped caring about them and whether these two kind of annoying and selfish people would find happiness together. at one point, they get lost in the woods as night falls. i confess i was hoping they would stay lost and the movie would end with them dying in the woods, dehydrated and not talking to each other. i\\'m not sure if that\\'s because i disliked them, just didn\\'t care about them, or just desperately hoped for some drama. spoiler alert: no such luck.i am curious to what you have been up to, so anything goes on this linky party!happy monday girls!furiously upon the futilityembroidery floss in the same two colors

meets have the traditional 4x1 and 4x4, but this early part of the season you can find lots of meets that run almost every kind of relay imaginable. distance runners get to run relays with 4 x 800, distance medleys, and even 4 x 1600. field event competitors too, with long jump, high jump, shot put, and discus relays (and others) where the marks of four competitors are totaled together to determine a team winner. it all leads to tremendous excitement.i haven\\'t been making cards all that long. actually, it\\'s two years this month. i\\'m not sure what got me started. i\\'ve always loved to create and craft and i was just cruising the internet and kept seeing lovely cards using rubber stamps and sizzix cuts and knew i could have fun doing this. of course my cards from 2 years ago, consisting of a layer or two of paper and mediocre pencil coloring, are a lot different from my cards of today with multiple layers of cardstock on the front and both inside surfaces, stitching,

got ourselves into downtown vancouver (via the magnificent seabus that crosses the water between north vancouver and its southern cousin). there we saw for ourselves the (ice) hockey fever that had a hold of the city thanks to the stanley cup. ice-hockey is canada’s national sport pretty much and vancouver’s team, the canucks, was several matches into a play-off set of finals against the boston bruins. we also saw an electric car fair down near the science centre, a lot of people on bikes and skates as well as the annual dragonboats races out on false creek (take a look at the map – vancouver is surrounded by many different bodies of water). mark saw straightaway that the city he remembered had grown somewhat (condos, condos, convention centres, giant hotels… a lot of work done for the winter olympics in 2010). and it looks like it’s still growing… plenty of cranes on the skyline.\\r\\nbut i digress. where was i? oh, yes - ‘crime fiction and contemporary ireland’, maynooth

shamanic week! good lord. here\\'s a true story from this week. i went to see the sufi acupuncturist on one of his last days in the office space he has occupied for six years. on the way into the building i noticed something smelled good but i didn\\'t give it much thought. when i walked in the office, the first thing i noticed is that everything was off the walls and out of the space except for the bare necessities - a couple of chairs in the reception area and a folding table, laptop, a phone. that was it. the sufi acupuncturist was standing in reception when i breezed in. he turned to me and said, \"oh! you\\'re wearing (some chinese word).\" i was confused. he said, \"it\\'s the scent in chinese medicine that cleanses energy.\" i said, \"i\\'m not wearing any scent.\" he took a step closer and sniffed me, nodded, then said, \"but you can smell it, right?\" i could! it was that good smell from the sidewalk. i said, \"i noticed it smelled nice outside.\" he then went to the door to his office, leaned out into the hallway and smelled, shook his head slowly. i said, \"it smelled nice outside but not in the building.\"when we went to the library on thursday, emma was drawn to the bin of board books. seeing as she likes to listen to books that are geared towards kids who are 8 and older (we are currently listening to inkdeath, the third in the inkheart trilogy), i

estimate somewhere between 50% and 85% of what you care about in selecting a linux server is the current, expected future, and realized future feature size of the fab producing the server’s microprocessors and chips. there are lots of other important variables: system and microprocessor architecture, programming languages, network transmission lines, compilers, operating systems, file systems, databases, etc. and each alone can make or break a finquant app, but they are all tails. the microprocessor fab feature size is the dog, it effectively determines how well my finquant infrastructure scales with moore’s law. the comparative technology priority has not always been this way. there used to be different instruction set architectures, networks were slower than drams, and memories were small all requiring evaluation in addition to the shrinking microprocessor fab feature size. in all likelihood the comparative technology priorities will change in the future as well.sorry, but i am staying away from change, i told them.so you begin… and fail.they dealt with the norwegians and tying it into carpenter’s the thing as an afterthought; the scenes that tie them

which slowly swung open to reveal a passage beyond. they started up it but they had only got half way when the creature reappeared behind them and attacked again. elysia’s attacks caused it some

if we had any. sure, you need programs to train kids, give them some skills so that they can make an honest living. we have some of those, probably not enough. but you need something else. you need to remove the alternative. what we are dealing with is a society in which for a couple of generations now the most attractive option for those growing up with fuck all is criminality. looking around me, all my life it\\'s seemed the easiest, most lucrative thing for those on a low income to improve their situation is to start dealing drugs. the risk of a criminal record isn\\'t enough to stop people

combat system is generic and at times, way too basic. you can’t control your other party members and a lot of them are pretty worthless, meaning the only reason you recruit them is as a requirement to

reject this command is a reject of god, more specifically the spirit which god has given them. the spirit was to paul the fulfillment of gods promise to purify and renew the people of god (ezekiel 36:25-27; 37:14). it was an indicator of the inauguration of the messianic age and as we see from galatians and romans, paul saw the spirit as the eschatological ethos in which the people of god live and by which they war against the flesh (or the present age). therefore, to live and please god with our vessels (v. 4) is completely in line with gods new age that is experienced now by being in the spirit. therefore to reject this commandment is to war against the spirit and to reject god.commissionerand lastly, you were the one to share my sadness; the one who cried with me in that cereal

an entire episode revolves around jack’s relationship with a man in 1927, featuring some very graphic sex scenes, and an emotionally engaging storyline to go along with it.

make different choices, even small ones to change the direction we are going in. am i saying i don’t believe in fate? i don’t know, maybe those changes we make are part of our destiny as well…

great changeremember that certain things remain constant in times of change: we, as public servants, still have a service to provide to canadians.i have had some awesomely weird tables in my many lunch shifts these past two weeks. the best one being my first table sunday. i was folding napkins when the hostess seats a middle aged man with a puffy gray david hasslehoff mullet. he was with a very trim, very made up brunette. the doop (the paper that tells me their name, how many reservations they\\'ve made before, when they sat etc.) said they were a recommendation from a local hotel concierge. awesome, so that means they\\'re too lazy or think they\\'re too busy to make an actual choice on restaurants and blindly go where someone tells them to. this bugs me, who is so important they don\\'t have time to be adventurous, this friggin\\' guy. i glance at the top of the doop, the last name is french, ok no big deal. i greet them and welcome them, give them the whole deal about how our water is filtered a whole song and dance basically asking them in they want sparkling or flat water. after some debate they and by they i mean he told me what they wanted. i turned and told the new server assistant what they wanted while i went to go do something in the back. as i came out the s.a. told me i\\'d told him the wrong kind, they wanted flat water not sparkling. oops, well it\\'s just water, no big deal. oh boy was i ever wrong. when i went over to let them know the specials, he literally puts his hand up in a stop motion while i\\'m talking and interrupts me. he points to the water glass in front of him and says \"you brought me sparkling, i obviously asked for flat. if you can\\'t understand my accent because i\\'m french tell me now\"...the brunette accompanying him looked pained. my mouth nearly fell open, i understand you\\'re a dick. prick is the same in swahili, vietnamese, english or french. a dick is a dick no matter what language, a dick with a stupid haircut is especially annoying. if you\\'re this picky about your water this is going to be a very painful table. i smile and tell him it was a simple mistake, one that i will not repeat. i manage to tell them the specials even they they\\'re not listening. the inspection of each others cuticles was far too engrossing. did i mention they were sitting side by side at a four top table? yeah, i hate that. if you\\'re going to be that couple that insists on sitting in a 4 top booth, don\\'t be so lovely that you need to sit next to one another and whisper,it\\'s wierd. you\\'re adults, not 4 year olds no one cares what you have to say it\\'s ok to sit across from one another. you\\'re not exactly communicating confidential nuclear secrets here. so he orders the hanger steak, but it\\'s not that easy no, of course not. mister frenchyhoff wants it black and blue. \"do you know what that is?\" \"yes sir i am familiar with that temperature.\" why would you want your hanger steak pittsburgh? you\\'re an idiot. \"good, because you didn\\'t understand me before, blue is very rare, cold and rare. do you understand?\" diiiiiiiiiiick. i nod and smile and write \"temp-d bag\" on the slip of paper in my book.not only b&b he wants the sauce on the side, of course. his lady friend orders the salmon. it\\'s too early on a sunday to play your psychic friend ma\\'am i need to know which salmon? i ask her what temp she\\'d like her salmon and she just stares at me. i know this means she has no idea what this means, i think she\\'s probably only eaten her salmon smoked or from a can. i kindly tell her salmon usually comes medium rare or even medium, and would she like that? then i get the idea to talk her into the salmon and eggs, to just avoid this whole fiasco, after 3 recooks the night before i didn\\'t want to make the managers run anymore redcards. salmon and eggs is smoked and always good i tell her. \"oh fantastic, sauce on the side please\". sauce on the side is health conscious i understand but it\\'s really annoying and the cooks hate it. so after their entrees come out i do a check back. i had mentally prepared for the fussing i was sure to hear. frenchyhoff complained that his steak was dry and asked me if they cooked it in the sauce and then cooked it off. what sauce, the bearnaise sauce? i think not. i smile and since i was tired of listening to his lispy french bullshit i tell him that the sauce and the steak are cooked entirely separate. i didn\\'t mention that a hanger steak is known as the butcher steak for a reason as it\\'s not fatty and if you pittsburgh it, it\\'s going to be dry. it\\'s not a ribeye or a ny strip, there\\'s not enough fat to make that great. needless to say when i saw the 13% tip i wasn\\'t really upset.he may well

we are known as “the biggest kid.” we play and run around with the little ones but also maintain our respect. we lead by example and play a significant role in how a child is raised. i must add however, that we do not replace mommy or daddy, but instead are that “extra pair of hands” that only enhance and help the parents out when needed. parents want to come home and bond with their children and during the day time most parents are away at work which doesn’t leave much time for errand running. we create a balance for parents so that their time with their children is special and not full of mommy in the kitchen or the laundry room. i could ramble on and on about a nanny, but im pretty sure i gave a clear idea. but if you are still curious, or would just simply like to add a

‘broad-minded’ consensus is that we are all equal, irrespective of skin colour. professor rushton’s assumptions, based on extensive scientific research, does not suggest that the overall characteristics of one specific race is superior to another race, but it does reveal that life-history evolution is still in progress, and that there are major differences between the races. why are we then ignoring this conclusive evidence, and why are we not using the data for the benefit of all mankind?congrats! can i take a chance for this supercady? i have put a link on my blog afcourse, how

writers. they underline phrases on a page. they utter “yes” when some passage resonates. if the writer is similarly in love with themselves, it’s easy to succumb to this society of mutual admiration. thank god i have a patient husband, and luckily i haven’t given him too many instances to be patient about. i have been told, more than once, by more than one man that i am the “manliest woman

somewhat masculine appetites: good whiskey, raw oysters, rare meat, sporting dogs, leather, european cars, and bawdy jokes.first of all, i would like to look at its official website,

gurls\" when an approaching car unexpectedly turned in front of me going, like, .000001 mph. it came as no surprise that a blue-haired old lady was driving the car. i don\\'t want to speculate about how old she was but i\\'m confident she learned to drive chariots when ramses ii was pharaoh. i slammed on my brakes and it took every ounce of self-restraint i had to not give her a friendly, one-finger wave. however, it\\'s hard to flip off mummified old ladies when you\\'re been singing offkey to perky music. upon closer observation, i realized she was attempting to turn onto a sidewalk instead of the entrance of a nearby parking lot. a long time ago, the university put up some short cement pillars at the entrance of the sidewalk so that confused drivers wouldn\\'t turn onto it thinking it was the entrance of an interstate freeway or something. i fully expected the driver, after realizing the cement pillars were blocking her path down the sidewalk, to back up and get the hell out of my way. no. she sat there…honking her horn. yes. honking her horn. so i thought, \"well, maybe she\\'s having a heart attack or something…\". so, i got out of my car and asked if anything was wrong. she rolled down her window and exclaimed in an irritated voice, \"well, i keep honkin\\' my horn but nobody\\'s openin\\' the gate!\" i just stared back and blinked. i then explained that the cement barricade was not a gate and the \"road\" she was trying to turn onto was actually a sidewalk. \"a sidewalk?!\", she bellowed back. i then pointed out where she should turn to get into the parking lot. meanwhile, cars were backing up in both directions because she was blocking both lanes in her huge grandma-mobile that was only slightly smaller than the nile riverboats i\\'m sure she rode in as a child. she then started backing up and i walked back to my car. i got in my car and she was still backing up. i put my car in gear and adjusted the air conditioning and she was still backing up. after what seemed like 14 days, her back tires finally hit the opposite curb, she put her boat in drive, and she went on her merry way.immediately, i decided i wanted to do something scientific or medical related instead, and being really into the tv show csi at the time forensic science was appealing, but also medicine as due to my families multiple medical problems i had been

through certain circles in american society, a sort of backlash against what some consider to be a sense of elitism. this has lately taken the form of questioning the value of higher education. “what

end. \"i hope you didn\\'t have lunch,\" he said in that low, raspy voice of his. lunch? that was certainly unexpected. \"no,\" i replied, placing my recorder on the table and noticing that miles seemed to eye it with a hint of curiosity. it was not until several days later that teo macero, his producer, informed me that miles did not like to be interviewed on tape. it\\'s a good thing that i didn\\'t know that earlier. at the first ida cox session, ten years earlier, i had watched admiringly as whitney balliett took notes in what seemed to be shorthand and got every word and breath right. with miles, a tape recorder was an absolute necessity, and not only did he not balk at seeing it, there were a couple of occasions when he walked over to the bar and carried my recorder with him so that i wouldn\\'t miss a word.use a good vegetable peeler to peel the winter squash. use a large knife to carefully halve the squash and then scoop out the seeds and the stringy mess inside with a

and none of them were your traditional chinese dress).… she had two wedding gowns that were white and different styles, she had a silver, sparkly gown… 1930′s style… kind of gangster woman-ish, she had a deep, burgundy wine dress that was an empire waisted dress. all were very beautiful and her hairstyle changed with each one. dinner consisted of about 12 dishes of food, 27 tables, with wine,

(glenn greenwald has a great overview. it’s required reading for context on this issue.) the outrage in this case is hypocritical and ties back to the issue of bias. it was fine for williams to express his fears because he targeted our current national boogeyman. criticizing muslims is still fine and will be defended.now head on over to the inky impressions challenge blog and see the rest of the wonderful cards made by my inkette pals - you\\'ll love what you see there!article 12since the whole item is intended to celebrate a significant birthday for my younger sister, i added the year in i-cord. i was ten, and had always considered myself as the little one in the family, when my sister was born. fortunately, i have enjoyed her company from the first moment she came home from the hospital - how can that possibly be so long ago?in the past i’ve written about approaching this whole gay bar thing as a feminist and how difficult it is given how the girls and i were raised as sheltered school girls. well, andrina realized that again after karl and i left saturn that night robbie and i were reunited.a couple of days before, i saw the roh\\'s fidelio, and it was not a pleasurable evening. this met production is drab and dull and is thankfully being retired now - why did the opera house ever take it in the first place? i literally can\\'t be bothered to comment on it any further, so i\\'ll move onto the singing which was mostly fine, but never spectacular. steven ebel is a tenor currently in the roh\\'s jette parker young artists programme, and took on the relatively large role of jaquino. his bleating, mosquito like buzz of a vibrato is just not at all pleasant, and his cumbersomely gangly lope means he only moves badly on stage. this might seem unfair, as he\\'s theoretically still developing as a singer and artist, but the rohjpya scheme is meant to be a finishing school, a last port of call before the terrifying ocean of professional operatic life. i just cannot see that he will ever be successful.the fact is, parents have used “sign language” for years with their babies. babies need to express needs and parents want desperately to find out what their child wants or needs. so, often we will see gestures, whines, and partial syllables that mean something to a parent.swing bill started his racing career on the flat with gerard le paysan in france, but failed to win in five starts between october 2004 and januaryso what did i choose for project #1?

farc, as an example, started out as a marxist/communist terror group in colombia and is one of the oldest terror organizations around. in the 1980\\'s it started picking up the enforcer role for some of the drug cartels to ensure supply via terrorism applied to local communities, and when the cartels started to crumble farc picked up on narco-terrorism as its main methodology. unfortunately that is no longer even close to being in the marxist/communist realm and farc graduated from ideologically based terrorism to become a narco-terrorist organization which was also capitalist in its means. farc stopped being about anything, save for money and power. the secretive shining path, on the other hand, continues its smoldering and pretty useless terror campaign by remaining ideologically pure. the various red organizations of the 1970\\'s that dabbled in terror started out from a few, central terror organizations, but then had internal ideological disputes so that red factions and red groups and militant interior designers all started to show up on the terror landscape. hezbollah remains largely an arm of the iranian regime, but now has large external support bases so that it can work in ways that can often be at cross-purposes to iran. the plo factionated when it sought to become semi-legitimate and some of its virulent off-shoots went out on their own and some allied with

possibility and so this would create lots of tension. my determine was to find a solution, whatever that was. i was dealing with the teachers and with jeremy every day, not just in the morning or at bed time. when i took jeremy to school, the stress stopped for my husband, but not for me or his teachers. after speaking with numerous wives, i’ve discovered that the husbands don’t believe it, or want to believe it. it appears that because men feel that they must be strong in every situation and must cope many obstacles in life, and that having a son that is facing problems is just too much to bear. most of the dads of the boys with sid are in denial at first. the wives tend to have to deal with finding out what the issues are all by themselves by researching, talking and finding solutions. many of the husbands fight the wives to the end until the wife ultimately convinces her mate to “just speak with an expert”. in one case i know, the father uses the excuse, “he’s just like i was” so he assumes it is okay. meanwhile, everyone along with his wife is going crazy having to deal with his child. my friend is of the mindset that if there is help available, then she’s going to get it! in reality, many of these men are right, because the kid is just like them… and if there would have been help for their own mothers way back when, then the moms more than likely would have taken it instead of suffering straight through it and of procedure it would have made everything easier on the child. they could have learned tactics that would have helped them carry on their actions, their bodies and their behavior.and i still check the wardrobe in every room i stay in.i just thought i was late before. now i was definitely set back.how do you like the process now, amigo?the feast of the dedication was then taking place in jerusalem. it was winter. and jesus walked about in the temple area on the portico of solomon.but not everyone is standing by. richard friedland, the chief
