"Sugar’s sweet, so is she,"
"So because the Asian community was so by need tight-knit, the next thing you know I have Asian kids following me around, you know doing more shit for me than the boys that wanted inside of me. Especially the two in particular. They thought I was “so wonderful” which sickened me even further. I was not wonderful, it reminds me of that quote, from WWII era forget it but goes on to say something like, “It was not that I was a hero, it was everyone around me was acting so badly” when someone won a humanitarian award."
Nicholas’ brain runs on and is excellent at processing data and concrete facts. He works best with things he can quantify. He runs into an almost insurmountable challenge in trying to rationalize the existence of his exceptional infant daughter and what she represents. He isn’t without a sense of humor and is very loving but he is forced to radically confront his limitations.

"His own family had to witness exclusion and had to be apprehensive to be pusuited. So his grandfather decided to escape from germany in 1934, heading to Britain. This must never happen again, Andy says, and he tells about his worries about right-wing partys in Europe, which seem to get more popular again."

"My sweet boy, who I dote on, is quite capable of doing this (resisting training) for months. He has in the past and patience and consistency are called for and will win the day in the end. He might decide to get with the program this week, or it might be months. Time will tell, but I think I know now that this is a likely response from him when training goes to a new level."
"And so on, and so on..."
"For some reason I didn’t initially investigate any further into her catalogue, but then one Friday at work I was talking to another friend who loved Ann Peebles. The next day, on my way into town to the shops, I decided I simply had to buy a Peebles record. My first stop was Reckless in Berwick St, which still had a basement where a box of soul singles sat on the counter. Having inherited not only my dad’s hoarding tendencies, but his acute sense of relative value, I’ve never bought many 7″s (or “45s” as we must trendily refer to them now) and 9/10 times I deliberately avoid looking beyond the LP and 12″ sections in any shop. I was on a mission this time though and miraculously, as I began to flick, there it was, second record in the box, as if I’d just willed it there. I excitedly parted with my £3 and while I have no memory of what if anything else I bought that day, I remember it was definitely raining. Getting the record home, I had a bonus discovery with the equally brilliant b-side, part of whose intro is the backbone to a GZA track I was a bit obsessed with at the time (a huge proportion of early RZA production relies on the Hi back catalogue). In contrast to the a-side, the song is much more positive than its title indicates: she’s bidding goodbye to her troubles and sadness, or rather, as is more customary for Peebles, telling them to piss off."
"Forest City Ratner Companies and its Brooklyn Events Center subsidiary would have a tiny fraction of the jobs. Some 1000 part-timers would be hired by AEG, in charge of arena operations, and 900 hired by Levy Restaurants, in charge of food service."
"Then, the most exciting news of all, on August 19th our sweet baby Jane joined our family! She was born at 1:59 am after 7 hours of labor (which was so much better than Annabelle's 16 hours of labor) and was 7lb 6oz 20 in long. Jane looks a lot like Annabelle when she was a baby but they definitely have their own personalities. We are so happy this sweet baby girl could join our family and Annabelle loves her new little sister! Jane is such a little live wire. Right when Jane was born she could lift her head and was always moving. She isn't my cuddly baby like Annabelle was but still a sweet, happy little one. She moves so much she learned to roll over at 3 1/2 months! Now at 5 months she is army crawling everywhere!!! Crazy huh! She is just a little determined one and is probably going to walk soon I swear!!! Jane just had her 4 month Dr appointment and she weighed 12 lb 2 oz which makes her only in the 10th percentile . She is just a little one and it's probably because she moves all the time. Annabelle is such a good big sister and loves to make her laugh. If she is sad she gives her toys and tries everything to make her happy. But there are those moments when I hear Jane cry and I see Annabelle trying to ride on her back like she does with daddy, but I guess that is just what big sisters do. :) It gets kind of crazy being a mom of two now but I love it and it is always an adventure!"

"The firm of TrimTabs itself is taking a cautious stance and reducing its market exposure to zero from 50% exposure. TrimTabs’ reasoning is that the end of QE2 to spell the end of the ‘propping up of the market’. While certainly understandable, this is information that is all too well known and already priced into the market. They go on to write to their clients that the “S&P 500 is down 6.8% from its interim closing high on April 29, and we expect market action to get even uglier this summer.” Their terrible track record makes it tempting to fade them here."

"Wrists (bind): On a successful attack by a whipwhirl to bind an opponent’s wrist, there is a possibility the victim will “fumble” and drop anything it might be holding in its hands. The base chance of a fumble from a whipwhirl wrist attack is 100%, minus 5% per point of dexterity of the affected target (e.g., a character with a dexterity of 18 would have a 10% chance of fumbling on this type of attack.)"

"Here is a video where I talk about the tips and give you a tour of the system. I tried to write as clearly as I could in this post, but sometimes it’s better to just see it in action because it is tough to explain:"

"There are lots of guidelines - which lots of people treat as immutable laws - like 'show don't tell' and 'don't use 'was'' and so on. There are lots of distractions, like 'use 12 pt Times Roman' (I have never submitted a MS in 12pt Times Roman, and I have never had one rejected because it was in the wrong font). If I tell Adrian how I write, he might think that's my prescription for successful writing. It's not. It's possibly a very bad way to write - for other people. But it works for me. He will have his own way of writing that works for him. So much for the activity of writing - I'm not going to say 'you have to have a detailed plan' or 'never write a detailed plan'. But what I want to get Adrian to do, when I talk to him about his novel, is to understand what he is writing and how it works or could work. So I ask him questions like 'who is the narrator?' It is an omniscient narrator. 'Does this narrator have a character? Is he/she reliable? How do you switch between points of view? What are your main character's flaws? Which of his opinions do you share and which not? How does he change during the course of the book? Why?' And so on."

"I’m sure some of you have wondered how I got into western writing. I grew up watching Gunsmoke, Paladin, Bonanza, etc. My dad loved westerns. Top this with the fact I enjoy reading about history.

"Now any self respecting physicist, but more especially a graduate of Patrick Moore's 'Observer's Book of Astronomy', c.1969 (alpha-this, gamma-that is conspicuous in the winter sky, etc), should be able to read alphabetical greek... ""Argonautica... is that the Tim Severin expedition?"" - the one I'd read about in my father's Telegraph supplement? I'd just sailed back from Trebizond on the regular ferry after back-packing around Turkey. They'd just rowed a thousand miles in the opposite direction from Volos (Iolcos) to Georgia; their tremendous callouses bore witness to that fact, and to pretty useless winds. But they'd reached Jason's destination and found that people still ""pan for gold"" using sheep fleeces there, in the mountain streams."

"Grandma parked down the street from Bobby's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk. Then Grandma gave me a nudge. ""All right, Santa Claus,"" she whispered, ""get going."" I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell and flew back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma. Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open. Finally it did, and there stood Bobby."

"5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.

"It is ironically appropriate that the end of the bill’s main content is the definition of “self-protected entity”, a definition that when defined includes ANY entity other than an individual. It is important to encourage persons and citizens of democratic nations to read their laws and the legislation that affects them. Undoubtedly for some, this may be the first text of legislation they have ever read their entire lives, and it is important that they begin reading such texts. Do not let government spokesmen, or political and social commentators, though the screen or through text, tell you what is going to affect you, and how its going to affect you: You have a responsibility as a citizen to know what is going to affect you and your life, and of the lives that shall come after you. Internet Censorship."

I made an easel giftcard for a change. The card itself is made around a box of toffifee which cost me £1 from poundland. I removed the outer sleeve which leaves the chocolates still in their protective covering and used the sleeve as a template to make an outer wrapper for the box. I then made an easel card the same size as box which I attached to the box when it was decorated. It was quite easy to make and makes a nice (cheap) thank you gift! The papers and design are quite plain but I wanted the main focus to be on the image. If it wasn't a sample for TV and I was giving it away myself then I would probably make a matching box but I didn't bother.
"The second song litters the ear with a blistering insistent shower of metallic artillery of riffs, picking and spotting the senses like hailstones until a lull leads into a feisty and formidable display of towering riffs and sharp melodic manipulations.

"We grew up. We moved away. She's a social worker in Madison, now, and I'm an office manager and church organist in Milwaukee. We run into one another once in awhile at funerals. We both made it to adulthood, safe now from eagles, gypsies, and the threat of the Ickle Ockle bushes. I think of that on warm summer nights when the fireflies are out."
"Winter, the kind with snow, finally began here on Friday. It was short-lived though. I shoveled steps, decks, ramps, and pathways blanketed by six inches of heavy white stuff until my arm muscles turned wobbly. My mittens were stuck frozen to the shovel, and despite the frigid temps, my head under hat was laden with sweat. I felt like I had just finished an exhaustive hour-long gym workout. But like I said, the gorgeous winter snow was short-lived. Rain soon swept in and reduced the mass to about an inch or so of undulating ice. I have yet to try the car on the long downhill rink we call the driveway. A walk to the mailbox yesterday revealed coyote tracks, emerging from the woods into our drive and across the road. Bello, my feline walking companion, curiously sniffed the tracks, looking about with caution. I suspect that the coyote had walked as we did only a short time previous."

Written by Adam Gauntlett, whose previous contributions to titles published by Miskatonic River Press, Pagan Publishing, and Pelgrane Press, have all been well received, The Millionaire’s Special is a mini-adventure set on the RMS Titanic, in which several First Class passengers – or is that player characters – must face a threat already aboard the luxurious liner, whilst their players know that they will face certain death by adventure’s end."

No more putting off figuring out the rules for magic. The wizard has been backed into a corner and has to start explaining things to the trogg girl.

"Bad copy editing, on the other hand, introduces new errors while overlooking existing errors. Bad copy editing cites Wikipedia as a definitive source. Bad copy editing betrays cluelessness about the author's tone and style while revealing far too much about the copy editor's own limitations (and, perhaps, failed ambitions). Bad copy editing is painful. It takes time and is horribly enervating. Bad copy editing causes one to wear out pencils writing STET over and over. Stet is Latin for ""let it stand,"" which is to say, it is a veto of a correction. But if you have to write it too many times on a manuscript you begin to think it is actually the Latin for ""fuck off."""

"The much anticipated Sex and the City 2 movie has finally opened with lots of promotion and press as one might expect. I haven't seen it yet (have you?), but I've naturally been very interested in the look and feel of the movie. Based on the movie trailers and still photography that's floating around - we can definitely say that this movie is filled with color and texture. The TV series and first movie were more about the clothes, but this one seems much more about the (dare I say it?) surroundings. As Carrie says in the movie ""I've been cheating on fashion with furniture"". Music to our ears! Lots of other blogs and sites have been covering the interior design of this new movie, including lots of resources, so I'll post a link to those sites at the bottom. However, I thought it would be interesting to compare the evolution of the interior design from television series through the two movies. Since much of the creative team is the same, it makes for an interesting exercise, I think."

And ostensibly they abandon the sock and scramble after the treats and eventually they will abandon the sock on the command, no treats necessary."

And the past should stay the past, right, because people who tried to escape the labyrinth were seldom heard from again by those good and proper souls who kept their heads down and didn’t listen to the dreams that whispered to them in their waking hours. And you try not to think of all those wasted years in the darkness, because that only leads to Regret. And if Laziness is Fear’s bratty kid brother, then Regret is his sad-eyed spinster aunt."
"He likes to ""sweep"" with his little vacuum at any given time, but especially if he sees someone else using the real vacuum. Then he runs and gets his and follows them around. Cute. But this cute little habit has quickly become a weird obsession. He LOVES the real vacuum. If he sees it he goes crazy trying to pull the plug down and start pushing it. I have had to relocate it from its previous spot tucked between a shelf and a wall in the dining room to the mudroom. Oh and he loves brooms. The kid has a serious thing for brooms. He's constantly maneuvering himself around the gate to get into the mudroom to get one of the brooms and then he walks around sweeping. He does a pretty good job, to be honest! Or he tries to get the vacuum. It's a constant struggle with him. I'm pretty sure he wants to be a janitor when he grows up. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm just surprised that he's found his life's calling at 15 months old."
"Having qualified fifth, Alesi snatched third from his team-mate Gerhard Berger when the Williams of David Coulthard spun off on lap three. He eased past Damon Hill and on his 31st birthday, looked set for an excellent second place finish. For once, lady luck was shining on Alesi and dominant race leader, Michael Schumacher suffered a gear selection glitch that lost him a full minute. Driving the famous No.27 in Montreal, the number Canadian hero Gilles Villeneuve had in his Ferrari days, Alesi took the chequered flag at his 91st attempt. His Ferrari ran out of fuel on the slowing down lap to complete his lucky day. However after all the bad luck in his career, no-one could deny Jean his deserving moment on the top step of the podium."

"Kim Hyun-sung (Jang Hyun-sung), a hard-boiled fund manager, spends an evening of heavy drinking with his co-workers at a restaurant. A colleague shows up with some airsoft rifles, and soon all of them are pointing their weapons every which way and firing them in the busy restaurant. The server asks the guests to put the firearms away, and Hyun-sung ends up getting into a brawl with the waiter. The next day, following a probe into the company’s financial dealings and the suicide of one of his associates, Kim flees to the wooded retreat of one of his friends, hoping to recover his equilibrium. Instead, his buddy convinces him to take part in a war game with some friends. This vigorous if not wholly original exploration of the ruthlessness of business culture firmly embraces the dogme esthetic, the camera crew and boom mike being plainly visible in one restaurant scene.

I had one who spoke so softly I had to sit in front and still strain to hear. I had one who invited us all to his farm for the winter and summer solstice. He sat on his desk, swinging his feet, clad in dirty shit-stomping boots, smoking a pipe. I think he was high a lot. And I had one who scared the hell out of me. I don’t know why. But, he was a great English teacher and he loved poetry."

"Which leaves only it’s status as part one of an accidental trilogy (since Castrovalva wasn’t even remotely planned when this story and Logopolis wrapped). I suppose I’ve rather given the game away on that one by pointing out that it’s an accidental trilogy, but there it is - this is in no way intended to be the start of some high concept arc, and reading it through that lens is deeply misguided. Again, there’s some distant interesting aspect here - the way in which Bidmead and Nathan-Turner navigate the nearly impossible task of writing Tom Baker out of Doctor Who is an impressive piece of television show-running. They take the counter-intuitive but likely necessary approach of declining to make Baker’s departure the climactic event or allowing him to be the star of it, instead opting to build the Davison era’s trappings up around Baker and then finally delete him from a show that’s no longer his own. Certainly several major steps in that direction happen here."

"The massive, well-organized deployment of enormous sums of money by the business and (especially) the financial elites have in large measure made American politicians, regardless of party, into the tools of the wealthy elites: Bush cut taxes on the very rich to near-historic lows, and the right-wing Roberts court more or less legalized political bribery in the Citizens United decision, but it was Bill Clinton who began the deregulation of Wall Street that led first to massive profits for the few, then to an terrible crisis for the many, and it was Democrat Chuck Schumer who kept capital gains taxes so low that most hedge fund managers pay taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries. The Koch brothers and those of their ilk don't consider themselves stewards of national well-being, not really: they consider themselves people who have a right to buy the means to rig the system ever-further in their favor. For them, this is simply their prerogative. Acting on this presumed prerogative has made them very wealthy, but it has also made their whole class less and less legitimate in the eyes of the public, despite the constant drumbeat of political advertisements and the far-from-disinterested vision of events presented on Fox News and other corporate media platforms."
"My review of the first reading of Still Life can be found here (Feb 2009). I remember liking the book and being impressed with Penny's style of writing and I enjoyed the characters, hoping we would meet them again in future books. And we did get to chum with them in the sequels. Penny unwraps parts of each character and lets us slowly get acquainted with them as we might a new friend. In this reread I was reminded of earlier descriptions of the characters and to see them in light of what I knew about them from later writings. My word, they are such multi-faceted, complex, flawed, and yet lovable people. The following quote illustrates how well Penny brings her characters to life, as well as her understanding of human nature and her gift for expressing it in writing."

Also, no less important we want to give their parents a rest, some quiet and a little bit less to worry about.

Even at the age of 50, she’s far too tough on herself. V.I. does some considerable soul searching while assuming the persona of a champion whose mission it is to right injustice."

They are told that their donations are vital to “defend” or “protect” the Church, that they are key to “expanding” the Church (buying more real estate). So they give more and more money."
"The Theme is Spring cards and Violets always remind me of spring. Since I'm an amateur photographer, I also took a bunch of pictures of my spring violets, so I decided to use them as the focus in my card. I have a small collection of copic markers and have been practicing blending colors, so I though I'd try using my pictures I took."

Conducted with independent assurance from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the model measures the number of people globally who, on an average day, read FT journalism in print and online.

It lamely asserted that RAINBOW RESPOSABLE creates an incongruity because ""a reusable and disposable rainbow does not exist.""

"The rest of the night all I tried to do was think of other things to keep my mind off of what was going on. I said a prayer and actually felt pretty good after it was over and I took that as a good sign. Heavenly Father knows what is best for me. When I woke up all I wanted to do was get into the doctor and see my baby and to know what was going on. Lincoln came with me this time and we were both so nervous, I couldn't stop shacking. The Doctor walked into the room and said that he was thinking about me and worrying about the baby and said he was hoping that he was just over reacting yesterday. I started crying before the ultrasound even started. The moment she was on the screen you could see her little heart beating and right at that moment you could tell she was okay. Her heart was beating perfectly. She was up to 165 bpm again. Which is normal. I started crying such a wave a relief rushed all over me. I love listening to her heart it sounded so much better then yesterday. The doctor checked her again and again to make sure she looked great and she did. I am going back in 2 weeks to make sure she stays the same."

I may be a junkie for unliterary crack. I don't pretend to know what constitutes ""social substance"" or ""artistic importance"" in a short story--and I'm not sure that I'd want to read anything by a writer who was so self-important that they'd try to tell me something socially substantive or artistically important anyway!”"

"Posters and fences enclose the wasteland, although not much effort has been expended in keeping them up, revealing an absolutely huge, poisoned-looking grass expanse, broken up by two buildings and a public sculpture. The wager was that 'Boro might become a tourist destination, if Alsop and invited architects like FAT were to be given their head; the renders in front of the wastes show a Super Mario World which bitterly contrasts with what is in front of your nose. The public sector levelled the area for, so far, an optimistic temporary suite designed as an aptly upturned lime green box, and the new Middlesbrough College by Hickton Madely at Archial. This is a huge building, and aside from the Bridge it dominates Middlehaven, its curving mass covered in a silver and yellow cladding, with small windows punched into it at random. Round the back, it's a huge white shed, as if we wouldn't be looking. Far away is the other building – the Docks' Clock Tower, attributed to Philip Webb – tall, gaunt and profoundly haunting in this dreamlike, spacious and sinister context. Between the dereliction is red and black landscaping, carrying at least some of the renders' cartoonish promise, connecting the area to the football stadium, or to another publicly funded project – Anish Kapoor's Temenos."

"It is clear to me that in today’s context, the lever to move the world, or should I say equity markets, is free money. Sure, central banks don’t have a choice when the new orthodoxy is for governments to pursue austerity with great fury but it’s also expressly meant to lever the stock markets of the globe out of their doldrums."

"We are not even quite sure what the allure of Jack Falstaff is. We'll call it the 'James Ormsby Je ne sais quoi factor'. The attraction is certainly not the look of the space, hidden behind a sleek, industrial doorway. The interior is modern but ordinary, dressed in velvetines and sagemint greens that could have jumped straight from the pages of a West Elm catalogue. The ambience fares well from the low, highly-polished dark wooden ceiling that subdues the sound allowing a dinner conversation to flow with ease, thereby helping to keep the dining experience a relaxing affair."

Later, Absalom rebelled against his father… and he won the heart of many of the men of Israel as he formed a conspiracy to take the throne. A battle ensued… Absalom died, hung by his own hair."

My first mini album took me 9 months to complete... yes, I said MINI album... and I was so scared to tackle each page that I hesitated, scrapped, hesitated some more...

If you are new to scrapping or break out in hives when it comes to mini albums, here is one of my favorite design tips... Go simple and use ONE line of paper. Don't worry about matching this embellishment to this tag to that paper... choose a line of product that was designed together... it will all match beautifully and make your job MUCH easier!"

I realized that even if this was nothing, something, someday, something tragic and life changing is coming. Whether its to me or a loved one, its coming. And I need that reality to change my life.

"Stepping outside after dark was the biggest treat of all; a veritable cornucopia of astrological delight enveloped me and captured my immediate and unwavering attention. Had it not been for the incessant attack of viscous sandflies I could have stayed there all night, every night, gazing up in awestruck wonder. As it was, it became a nightly ritual, after putting the littlest hobo to bed we would head out into the inky darkness and stand in front of the house looking up for a few minutes, the void of silence echoing on the mountains that surrounded us.

"Well, this was one BIG issue with me since I couldn’t stand Baby #1 wrestling with the Lact-Aid. But this time around I learned a tip. Get one of those lactation bras where there is a triangle (my hubby calls them the butt-chaps bras because they look like those cowboy chaps with the whole for the bum). Stick the Lact-Aid in that space right at the middle and then run the tubing under the fabric that goes on top of your breast. This reduces the odds of it shifting around AND keeps you from having to use tape. Yes, the wrestling will still happen, but this helps."
"One may ask, How can something be inside and outside at the same time? Parīkṣit therefore names a prominent Vedic deity: Vāyu, god of the sky.

Similarly All-Attractive Hari is the soul within everyone and everything, yet is an individual person as well, greater than and distinct from everyone else."

"A president’s likeability is much overrated. Hoover may have been unliked, but the same can’t be said about incumbent losers Ford, Carter, and George H. Bush. Those presidents lost their re-elections because voters perceived them as unsuccessful in their jobs. Most voters would have gladly sat down over beers with any of those three men."
"Much more prominent in the novels than in the series. Novel Dark Passenger (DP) is portrayed as a separate, conscious entity that lives inside Dexter and drives much of Dexter’s Need to kill. It’s described as being able to enter a person who has experienced a severely traumatic event, especially as a young child. While some feel this “possession” element of the novels spoils the storyline, I think it adds an interesting supernatural element and allows for more storytelling freedom."
Days like yesterday make it all worth it.

"I am so grateful for the way that my faith shapes my life and my values and for the way that it strengthens me and leads me to good things. I am grateful that because of faith, I am able to be brave in the face of hard things, to feel joy in the midst of trials, and to have hope in the future. Could I be a mother without faith? Sure. But faith makes me a much better mother than I could ever be on my own."
"I notice no one's criticising Jennifer's extremely well muscled, well nourished looking male co-stars. It's fine for them to look as if they've been eating enough to keep alive. Apparently it's only female actors who have to bow to 'realism' to such an extent that they should look gaunt, bony and as if trying to draw a bow would snap them in half."
"Taylor took to the screen early in life, however, long before her shapely figure caught up with her beautiful face. I recall watching the National Velvet movies as a kid, but haven’t indulged in them lately. It is not often that child stars can actually last past their cute youth and make it in the grown up world of film. I almost separate Taylor into two actresses because the adorable, sweet roles of her childhood contrast so differently from the later work."
"A must-have book for all vampire fans, A Brief History of Vampires charts the phenomenal craze of ‘popular vampires’ such as Nosferatu and Count Dracula to screen vampires such as those played by Bela Lugosi and Robert Pattinson. With the current global vampire craze taking the book, film and TV charts by storms with the Twilight saga and True Blood, this book begs the question: why do we love to be frightened?"

"A bacteria to me looks like a blob that can move. That’s pretty cool when I think about it. A blob of mayonnaise can’t move (and I’m happy about that). But under the microscope, blobs move. Hopefully not the mayonnaise blob. But bacteria blobs move."
"“Well then,” I say cheerily, trying to lighten the mood. “Let’s go find some breakfast.” We split up and I pick some berries from the scraggly bushes growing in the rocks. Henry manages to find some mushrooms and two walnuts. Gypsy and Todd wait patiently while we dangle our feet over the edge and gobble down our meager breakfast. The fog is lifting and we can see for a few miles as the bottom of the ravine slowly climbs back up to meet the sky. My stomach still grumbles but I hand my walnut to Henry."

I have read blogs for years, I love reading blogs and have always wondered what I could have a blog about. Would anybody read it. What would I write about. Well there has been plenty for me to write about really but it's finding the time to sit down and actually write. So today, here I sit, looking at my very disorganised house, clutter everywhere and I have to do something about it! So I thought, I will blog about my disorganised life and hopefully it will become organised once again.
In a face-to-face interaction we can support our verbal message with our body language, for example, the former President Bill Clinton was known as a very capable public speaker. Much of what he said in his speeches was communicated with hand gestures. Gestures are a very powerful way to amplify one’s intentions in public speaking. They also serve as a channel to bring the audience into the speech (which Clinton excelled in). This is also one of the reasons why Clinton’s supporters or even non supporters believed what he said at the time. His gestures aided his overall credibility.
Ryan “So Hot the Water” Broyles tore his ACL in November 2011 the same way the compact receiver tore through BIG12 defenses, becoming the NCAA receptions leader with 349 catches. He will probably be selected in the 3rd round, although he could fall further. While his height is limited and his speed is unknown until he fully recovers, the kid a extremely talented and a solid route runner. He could end up being the steal of the the draft if he falls down further than the third round. If fully recovered, he should be able to contribute early. Just five months removed from his ACL surgery, Broyles recorded a 32.5-inch vertical jump and 4.57 time in the 40-yard dash at his Pro Day. There is no doubt that he should be faster by the start of the 2012 NFL season.

"Since watching a number of episodes of The Electric Company (yeah, Netflix!) she completely understands the concept of the silent E and while she doesn't know yet which words have a silent E and which don't, if she is struggling to say a word and I tell her ""silent E,"" she can immediately say it; she knows exactly what each vowel should sound like in that situation. I think it's really cool how easily she learned that and how well she knows the vowels' different sounds. The Electric company has also taught Sweet Pea how to read words with 's or 've or 'd, etc. at the end. She doesn't yet fully understand possessive uses of apostrophes, but she totally gets that ""doesn't"" is a contraction of the words ""does not."" It is incredible how easily she picks up some of this language stuff!"

"For there was something fundamentally very evil going on in that school, though my brothers and I were fortunately, miraculously untouched by it. During the years I was there, five of the ten teachers (three brothers and two laymen) were sexually abusing many of the boys entrusted to their care. One of them was the tall young brother teaching the class parallel to ours, a class in which I was often a guest on the (not infrequent) occasions when Mr. Mooney called in sick. His ready use of the cane ensured that he had no discipline problems. He also had the custom of having boys sit on his lap for long periods of time – fortunately, he had his particular pets and we guests were not selected for this “special” treatment."

We, the unseen masses of men, women, and children with broken pee machines, are usually crippled by a bladder flare."

"Oppression is what the non-dominant groups of a category experience, which is essentially not having the same treatment and access to resources/privileges as the dominant group. For example: Aboriginals receive a significant amount less from welfare than non-Aboriginals. Internalized oppression is when an oppressed person begins to believe the stereotypes and awful statements about their group; for example, a Black woman begins to believe that she is not as deserving of fair treatment as White people are, or a gay man believes he is a sinner and is flawed for ‘choosing’ to be gay. Lateral violence is when, as a result of this, an oppressed person retreats to his or her group, or perhaps lashes out at the dominant group or at the very least, refuses to interact beyond his own culture; we see this when people react poorly to interracial dating, for example."

"Knowing it is indefensible, the various self-investigatory reports will try to hang their underlings out to dry and tell us Mark Kennedy was a rogue officer straying off-mission. When all seven exposed officers behaved more or less identically, the police need to tell us how many it takes to prove that far from following orders, this was strategy. And more than that, who devised, approved and ordered this political policing?"

"The other day I was looking at the line up for The Great Escape and I couldn’t help but be amused and pleased by a lot of the band names. Forgive me for not being more ‘down with the music-o people’, but I hadn’t heard of a lot of them, so these band names were completely new to me. I wanted to share some of my favourites on Twitter, but the list was getting longer and longer, so I thought I’d bore anyone that’s going to accidentally stumble across my blog with it."

That’s because the difficulty level is dynamic, based on the players competing."

"Some accounts state that wedding rings did not become common until the 11th century. Others believe the ancient Romans were the first to offer wedding bands, but they were a symbol of ownership used to claim women. Historic accounts give a little more romance to the Romans. Roman betrothal rings were once made of iron and called ""Anulus Pronubus."" They symbolized strength and permanence. It is also thought that the Romans were the first to engrave their rings."

"Finally, there is a new butcher, imaginatively titled ""The Butcher Shop"". It's near Woolworths, in the square in the corner. From Woollies, go past the chemist and jeweler, and look to the right, across from the Shiny Things Shop. (Not its real name.) They're in the new tradition of butchers, with house-made sausages and ready made kebabs and marinated ready-to-go roasts. They stock King Island beef. I haven't checked all the details about what's local and what's free range yet, but I can say that the sausages, silverside and lamb chops that I've had so far have all been top quality."
"Well, after putting up with his insults (like ""nice bangs"" in reference to my current Yul Brynner 'do) I actually piledrive the kiddo a few times which doesn't do much for him, given his spine seemed to be made of a slinky.

The rapier-like witticisms kept on a'comin' (I remember him shouting ""Keep your cholesterol-laden hands off me!"" as I tried yet another debilitating wrestling move) though soon the social intercourse (no, not that!) was broken up by none other than mother, who chastized me for treating company in such a way even if that company was an annoying rock critic bigmouth who was more'n responsible for helping destroy the Generation of Bangs and Meltzer and turning it into one big Voice of Whoredom!"

Ingram ~ With You ~ Other End ~ 1984
"While he had a strong enough grip to get the job done in college, I’d like to see Andrew continue to improve his functional strength at the next level. He shows good hand placement with proper technique in his ability to fire his hands inside on the defender and uses his flexibility and wide frame to make it difficult for rushers to get around him on the edge. I’d like to see Datko get stronger in the lower half in order to improve as an anchor in pass protection, as he isn’t yet strong enough to take on and consistently neutralize some of the bigger, stronger ends he’ll face at the next level. He’s not a full-fledged drive blocker in the run game, and while he’s shown enough of an ability to execute down blocks in college, I’d like to see him continue to develop better lower body strength to improve here. In the run game, he uses his quick feet off the ball to his advantage with his ability to engage the defensive lineman off the ball before attempting to properly position the defender away from the hole to wall him off an open up a clear running lane. Having played in Florida State’s zone-blocking offense, he could be an intriguing fit for the Packers blocking scheme."

"Sometimes after a long day of wandering and singing and climbing trees and playing, we would lie down in a cool green thicket under a lacy curtain of wisteria, and Rabbit would fold his arms around me prayerfully. I would rest my head in his warm hair and he would say, “I love you too much to ever use you.” He was one of the dearest men I have ever known, and I regret losing track of him when he moved away to the west coast."
"Even though the Powhatans returned the prisoners and some of the equipment they had captured, the colonists were not satisfied and a year-long negotiation began. In that time Pocahontas remained captive in the town of Henricus where she fell under the influence of Reverend Alexander Whitaker, who persuaded her to embrace Christianity. While there she also succumbed to the romantic advances of John Rolfe, a pious tobacco planter who had recently lost his wife. After being baptised under the new name of Rebecca she married Rolfe on 5th April 1614. In January the following year, the couple had their only child, Thomas Rolfe. While the marriage did not secure the return of all the colonists' possessions, it did cement amicable relations between them and the Powhatans."
"Our attending this show was an idea that came about because we need to reach a new audience.

You know, I think (much like Oprah – another childless mommy advisor) that the hardest thing you can do is raise a kid. And even harder is raising a kid right and saving the world from the addition of one more a**hole. This is of such monumental importance in my opinion, that it does, indeed, take a village. So, I’m here to help. As I was working up some research this morning, I came across some parenting ideas / actions/ products that I feel could lead your child astray. I am here to try and stop you…or rather stop the ridiculous human being who would subject their child to any of the below."

"It was once that individuals that have been going offshore on cross country cruises selected boats that had been extremely heavily built and were generally not to fast, often unresponsive using conditions. Tactics on these boats were somewhat distinct from the engineered boats these days. These older era boats could well be forced to heave to or lay a hull in two extremes. The crew would close everything up and go below and wait out. Sometimes this was successful, sometimes it wasn’t."

"But as with any adaptive strategy, it eventually becomes maladaptive. If an organism cannot evolve to match changing conditions--in this case, rapid fossil fuel depletion, climate change, soil degradation and so on--then dieoff or extinction can follow. And, just because I and many others can articulate the problem, it does not at all imply that a meaningful and broad-based understanding can spread and that a response can be implemented in time to avert the worst. Every fiber of a human being instinctively rejects limits on energy gathering--unless those limits can be framed as a necessary sacrifice for the good of a group to which that human being feels a strong attachment."

In the midst of feeling excited that it’s nearly time for my favorite Farmer’s Market to open, and in the midst of being happy that the warmer weather will soon be moving into Rhode Island and making it easier and more pleasant to eat lighter, fresher foods, I was nervous about how to actually plan and execute almost a whole month’s worth of gluten and casein free fare for us.

"It was all set to the primal rhythm of a steady thumping backbeat complemented by a bass line hitting you everywhere. It caused dancing of the simplest pattern; hop hop, switch foot, hop hop, switch foot, hop hop; arms swinging back and forth in time to the movement of the always bouncing feet. The grass was bright and green and standing when the man next to me started dancing this basic jungle influenced sway. By mid concert he had danced the grass flat, by nights end, to mud."

"This book just didn't do it for me, I'm sad to say. I think it does a good job in dealing with issues and questions that come up in the family dynamic. I liked that the point of view switches between each of Leah's family members instead of focusing on just the parents' viewpoint or just Leah's viewpoint. It showed how lack of communication and even miscommunication can create problems for a family. However, I like my fiction to have a balance. This book is just one depressing situation after another. Right after things start to seem a little better, another horrible thing happens. I will venture to say that most of our lives are filled with quite a bit of happy moments among the sad, frustrating moments, and I would have liked to see more of that."

After locating the car and returning it to their home, Cindy Anthony searched it and found a purse with information on a friend of Casey’s. Cindy asked the friend to take her to Casey’s boyfriend’s house. She confronted her daughter and demanded to see Caylee. They drove around for a while, then Casey finally admitted that she didn’t know where her daughter was. Returning to the Anthony family home, Cindy finally called police. Casey spoke to the 9-1-1 operator as well, and calmly told them that her daughter had been missing for four weeks, but she was afraid that her abilities as a mother would be questioned by authorities, and that is why she did not report the disappearance."

Be witty and charming and keep offensive opinions to yourself…. if you would like to be invited back), help clear the table (scrape the plates, rinse and stack. That’s enough.

First time writer/director, Warwick Thornton follows the film's two protagonists, a pair of Aboriginal kids living in a run-down community in Central Australia.

In fact, it was government policy that ‘Mother Tongue Education’ was compulsory for ALL RACES during the early formative primary school years.

I had never blown the insides out of an egg before without using specialized tools, but after googling how to do it and reading the first tutorial I came up with, I found out that it was pretty easy.

The eggs didn’t break."
"From the reptile store we hopped on a bus down to Jackson Square to hit the Farmer's Market for some lunch.

I find it extremely sweet, although that's not necessarily a bad thing after a spicy samosa!"

My hair is poker straight, won’t hold a curl and often has a mind of its own. It also can’t decide on what color it wants to be. It was blonde when I was really, really small. Then it was a mousey brown in early elementary school. Mid-elementary through my late teens it looked like it was chocolate brown until you got me in the light or sun and then I had a really dark auburn color."

"Historically server power benchmarks were not available and thus the only way for initial data center power planning was to rely on power data provided by system vendors in the form of faceplate values. But the use of faceplate value is flawed at the first place as it indicates the maximum power requirements for each component irrespective of its configuration or utilization. But the power consumption of a system is linearly correlated with its utilization. Because of this, a huge gap exists between the data center’s anticipated power require­ment and the actual power required by its equipment. Another option which is used is fixed de-rating where an arbitrarily percentage or number is subtracted from the nameplate value considering that the system’s faceplate rating is higher than its actual use. For example a 1,000 watt rated server would be de-rated by a fixed 20 percent which means you are assuming that it would consume 800 watts. However this is not true as its power consumption would be dependent on the utilization and estimated value most often is grossly inflated. As you might think, finding the correct percentage by which de-rating should be done is nearly impossible without any measurement tool. Two servers of the same manufacturer and model can consume different powers because of the utilization."

"Beatrice Shilling OBE, PhD, MSc, CEng was a highly talented aeronautical engineer - and motorcycle racer, gaining a Gold Star at Brooklands for her 106mph lap. She became hugely famous when she found an elegantly simple cure for the engine cutting-out problems experienced by Spitfire and Hurricane pilots when making extreme turns. It was a simple fuel-restriction device, like a washer with a needle valve, that was fitted into the SU carburettor and solved (nearly) the problem until pressurised carburettors were fitted to the Merlin engine. The little device became known as ""Tilly's orifice"" - and many of our brave fighter pilots owed their life to it."

It's chock full of loads of North American hops and has a sweet kick to it and a strong, pungent aroma that reminds some of cat piss. Others, such as Brown, of ""damp dishcloths"". For some in the room, it was their first experience of such a big beer. It was interesting watching peoples reactions. Some were instantly taken by it. Others, slowly won over by it."

But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. James 1:4 (KJV) You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. Hebrews 10:36 (NLT) “I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don’t tolerate evil people.” Revelation 2:2 (NLT) “I know all the things you do.

"Most gluten free bread is sold frozen. At best is is dense, and tastes funny. After moving to Austin, I went to the Whole Foods downtown for some lunch and shopping. The Whole Foods in Austin is HUGE. It is like a small city with several restaurants and lots of prepared foods. Anyway, we were in the bakery section, and I decided to ask someone stocking the baked goods if they had any gluten free bread. She pointed to a display where there were two kinds, white (potato flour) and whole grain (didn't notice, was too distracted by the white bread). I picked up the bread and it was SOFT! I teared up and yelled ""OMG it's soft!"" to my friend. I couldn't quite squeezing it and saying ""it's so soft!"" the whole time we were in the checkout. As soon as I got home, I opened the bag and ate a slice. It was amazing!"

"Georgians are also well-known for their friendliness and hospitality and I personally experienced this during my 2 visits. But closely watching over Tbilisi on one edge of the Narikala is the ‘Mother of Georgia’, a colossal statue of a lady holding a sword on one hand and a bowl of wine on the other. The wine symbolizes Georgia’s hospitality towards those who come as friends while the sword symbolizes the country’s readiness to quell those who come as enemies."

"It's easy to understand why. When it comes to value for money, vacation rentals including self catering options, they are small and more private space to yourself also makes it possible to spend as much as it would take for your transportation and sightseeing. You will have to worry about people partying or other disturbances around your own kitchen.

"If you have decided on your colour palette for the wedding, you should have a good idea of what colour your bridesmaids will be wearing. At that point, it is time to choose the bridesmaid dresses. Some women, when they think of a bridesmaid dress simply cringe, however with today’s new styles with charming ruffle trims, floral embellishments, flattering necklines, varied hemlines, and scope of fabric, there is no need to worry."

"Why did he let her leave, with his own back turned?"
"The first whiff is a clean, clear rye, much like the standard Sazerac, which yields to just a touch of fruit mixed in to the rye spice. The flavor is what grabs you right away. There is plenty of rye, but with a sweet, fruity note from the dessert wine, very unlike the sweetness you traditionally get from the corn in rye whiskey. Each sip is a mouthful of contrasting flavors - spicy and sweet, dry and fruity, whiskey and wine in perfect balance. The party continues into the finish. It's hard to believe that the few months this whiskey spent in the wine casks is enough to have such a pronounced influence on its character, but it can't be denied."
"Jerry Anomie was born in Tennessee but moved to Houston as a young child. Music never appealed to him growing up until a friend of his who worked at a record store played him the Sex Pistols and Iggy Pop. He ended up meeting Iggy soon after that, which helped give him a new outlook on life. Having recently spent five and a half years in prison, he started realizing he didn't have to be a criminal. He could be in a band!"

"What annoys me most of all is that upon being labelled a racist, you immediately refuted the claim and provided incontrovertible evidence of the opposite being true. Why wasn’t that the end of it? I too have Oriental help and, like you, am very fond of them. I like to give them a little slap on the buttocks as they clean my bidet in the home cinema and sometimes bow to them as they’re leaving for the day and say “ah so” as a show of cultural solidarity. I also found Mickey Rooney’s turn as Mr Fukkamoto (or whatever his name was) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s exceptionally funny, not because he ridicules Chinese/Japanese people, turning them into a preposterous caricature, but because he inhabits the role and brings out the inherent humanity of those two races. Why couldn’t people accept your affection for Asians on face value and move on? (Maybe next time mention Mickey Rooney.)"

Honey Irani appears in front of the camera in one of her first roles as an actress playing the mean and spoilt mommy’s girl Sheila. I love the way she stands and screams as an iron burns her sari rather than just lifting out a hand to move it away. She really does seem to believe she is the delicate flower her mother calls her and she wonderfully nasty towards her cousin. Ranjeet is appropriately sleazy and obviously the villain once he turns up in a selection of increasingly bad shirts and terrible scarves.

"OK, so this is supposed to be about getting a girlfriend fast……however, a common problem for single men (and indeed women) is that they are in way too much of a rush to find ‘the one’ because they are fed up with the dating game.

First and foremost, it’s become a great tool to keep myself on track and accountable, but it also provides a therapeutic way to process my feelings, figure out solutions, and track my progress. The fact that it’s become a daily destination for so many people looking for a little inspiration, honesty, laughter, or whatever… well, it astounds me. It’s a great source of pride. Thanks to this blog, I’ve been able to connect with and learn from so many wonderful people all over the planet, and that astounds me too!"
Having observed the assignment desk area with the NFL Network- I know how diligent they are with their breaking news. I am sure that they saw the news hit as soon as we did. I’m also sure they began calling everyone from police to team contacts for a confirmation and refused to report the news until they had solid facts confirmed.

"Therefore, taking into account that the thesis that is presented by the first Defendant, through the adequate means that are placed at his disposal by the other Defendants, raises the suspicion of the involvement of the first and second Applicants in the practice of criminal actions, albeit in a negligent way, among the general public, and that they, having been made arguidos at a given point in time, saw the criminal inquiry archived in relation to them, one has to conclude that it must be the rights of the Defendants that cede to the rights of the Applicants."
"Once upon a time, there was a red cell phone. It was an LG EnV3 that wasn’t really red, but maroon, and it belonged to Bekah. Every day, it faithfully did its job. It took her phone calls and collected her text messages. It rang and beeped mostly appropriately so that she would know to respond to the other people trying to contact her. Most of the time, the phone even maintained a good relationship with the Jawbone Bluetooth unit. They were hardly ever not on speaking terms, working in tandem so that Bekah could multitask and use her phone while driving. Life was good for the red cell phone. Many thought provoking discussions were facilitated by it, and even more encouraging and informative text messages were passed along by it."

I loved that Julia Quinn created this cinderella tale within the Bridgerton series. Although the book you were hoping that Benedict would see but he doesn’t well that is until the very end.
"In terms of plot, the book is well executed. Amy and J. C. hunt for the murderer and make some interesting discoveries along the way. When I found out who the killer was, I had a kind of duh moment but it didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the novel. I was interested in knowing how J. C. and Amy would trap the killer and how the killer managed to evade detection for so long. In some ways, the story’s evolution and world reminded me of Christine Feehan’s Ghostwalkers series or Jayne Castle’s novels (which is a compliment to my mind), though there are enough differences that the comparison was fleeting."
"When she isn't tapping away at her keyboard, Margaret engages in an epic battle against her never-ending laundry hampers, cajoles the flowers in her yard, sings into her hairbrush, and has been known to hold entire conversations speaking only in movie quotes."

"Overtime it is. Five minutes or sudden death.The toss is to our advantage, Thunder have the wind behind and the slight slope to speed the ball."
"The Jeffersonian Constitution has been misrepresented as much as or more than Jeffersonian philosophy. It was not “strict construction,” a nonstarter, nor even states’ rights. It was state sovereignty. Jefferson (and Madison, too) may be quoted ad infinitum to this effect. The Virginia and Kentucky documents of 1798-1800 spell out beyond any doubt that the final defense of freedom in the American system is the people acting in their only constitution-making identity, that of their sovereign states. The states were the legitimate and peaceful resort to protect the liberties of their citizens and themselves as communities from federal encroachment."

"Chris Mann from Team Christina finally returned to his opera roots, singing Ave Maria. As a not big fan, I was surprised because he almost won me over with this performance. His control and power and grace are undeniable, and this was definitely my favorite of his performances. I hope he sticks with more opera/classic songs that aren’t too ballad-y next week, songs that he can really go all out on without sounding too cliché."

"Despite Romney’s well-established ability to shape shift his positions on any number of issues or topics, depending what audience he’s talking to at the time, he’s worked hard to put himself into a corner on lending even a pittance of pity to union workers in general and public union workers specifically. His antagonistic attitude toward government at all levels, especially the federal government, promising to take an ax to it if he’s elected, seems to working against him in Ohio, where public union workers, their family, friends and supporters, have not only not forgotten the battle they waged last year over SB 5, the bill that would have effectively gutted collective bargaining as its been successfully practiced for nearly 30 years, but appear ready to send another message to those who want to rub out unions by voting for the President."

"Jurors heard recordings of those conversations this afternoon. In a June 9th 2010 conversation, Steele is heard agreeing to give Fairfax a $400 advance to pay for his trip to Oregon City, where Cyndi Steele was visiting her mother. However, Edgar Steele continues to contest the authenticity of the recordings, and one person posting a comment to this story maintains that audio experts identified 351 edits on these manufactured tapes. Unfortunately, the judge earlier ruled the two experts could not testify. Fairfax's testimony will continue on Thursday April 28th."

"The words of Carl Jenkinson underline the impact of one result, the ensuing wobble understandable. With the injury list at any one point in time containing a number of key experienced personnel, to have returned to form twice in one season is of great credit. Finding that consistency over the full campaign is the next step, a stride that has proven too great for some previous groups of Arsenal players in the last decade."
"I eat a healthy diet. I’ve been vegetarian for 10 years, and I recently became a vegan, due to some digestive issues and a possible link with my MTHFR polymorphism.

"My card base is kraft, with a mat of ivory, and then some ""chic"" dp bought at Mike's pad. Didn't show who put it out because I used part of it previously and so the name is gone..sorry people. It's a soft denim colored blue and ivory so I wanted to bring that out in my flower. After cutting the different size flowers I brushed them with denim colored ink that Adirondack puts out. Now for some fun I used the Scor-Pal and did a bit of pleating out of the ivory card stock and then added some crocheted ribbon stuff to give it that vintage look. Guess I need to use some of that on myself to add to my vintage look (mine is wrinkled skin and old age spots) not so classy, me thinks. After I slapped it together I added the little flag sentiment ""thank-you"" found in the Hello Hyacinth set. Put a few blingers on and I'm through here.So now it's your turn to get a bag (not a live one like me) and see what you can come up with.

"Like I mentioned, I’ve been big on getting cheese from the remnant or manager special box at bloomingfoods. The cheeses I’ve gotten recently are goat gouda, cocoa dusted cardona, and kentucky blue cheese. The remnant section is great because it gives you a chance to try a cheese you may not normally. It also allows you to have an expensive cheese for a fraction of the cost and without the fear of it going moldy in the fridge. Plus, if you’re cooking for one, you can make a small chunk of cheese last a for a few meals. If you’ve never had cardona before, I would suggest looking for it. It’s apparently an artisanal goat cheese from Wisconsin. The creator of it got the idea from one of his favorite sandwiches- a piece of swiss cheese and a hershey bar on bread. I can barely detect the cocoa in this cheese, fortunately. Anyway, I know a lot of people are leery to buy food that is marked down to sell. I’ve never had a problem, though, and it certainly beats paying full price."

"My baby is two years old today! Moms always tell me time with kids flies by. I believe them, and it seems to be so much more true as adoptive parents. Even though we met Zane when he was 16 months old, we feel like we've been his parents forever. In some ways it's like he's always been here, but in other ways, like today, it feels like I've only had him for a few short weeks. I'm not ready for him to be two already. It still seems like we just came home with him."
"A rambutan has that crazy sort of alien fruit look. It’s spiky tentacles are actually quite soft to the touch and make it even more exotic in appearance. Once red, these peel off easily with the skin which is a little woody, but pliable. You can break the skin with a knife or your fingernail and peel it back revealing a juicy translucent globe. There’s a clear seed inside which can be avoided once you bite into it or you can cut it out.So how does it taste? I found it to be a little bit melon-like but with the texture of a ripe grape. It sort of reminds me of a lychee, but not many people have tried that either so I don’t know if that helps. It doesn’t really drip juices, but seems like it should. Depending on the ripeness of the fruit, it can vary in sweetness, but I’ve yet to taste one that gives an unripe sensation; however, an overripe one can seem a little bit fermented. These are fun, but maybe a little too extreme to be seen regularly in a kid’s lunchbox. They can seem expensive, but there’s very little waste and it’s not like you’ll eat dozens of them. It’s a fun treat in the world of interesting fruit."

"You're trying to write a novel in a hurry. That means you can't afford to spend too much time sitting staring into space looking for inspiration. Whether you're an outline writer or strictly seat-of-the-pants, I'd recommend keeping at least a rough list of cool ideas that you might put in. Start noting stuff down sometime in September and keep the list to hand. Every time you find yourself staring off into space in November, the first thing you do is check the list."

One of them is even a Scottish Lord from Days of Our Lives! the humanoid Replicators have not quite hit T-1000 territory yet, but there are hints of their malleability and some mind reading powers. They are modeled after Reese, so they possess her flaw. The SG-1 team cons one of the more advanced models into betraying the others by convincing him their flaw is too dangerous to let them off world to reproduce. They plan to reverse the time device back to the way the Asgard intended and take him with them, but in reality, he becomes frozen in time with the others because even he is deemed too dangerous."

"...the school's so-called hidden curriculum, subtle presentations of political or cultural ideas, imparts important cultural values. School activities such as spelling bees and sports encourage competition and showcase success. Children also receive countless messages that their society's culture is both practically and morally good.Taught to think our culture is both ""practically and morally good,"" is it any wonder that things continue to be so bad? If our culture is good, then there's obviously no need to change things in any real or radical way. The same book also goes on to say that ""schools further socialize young people into culturally approved gender roles,"" something that, as a person who often chooses to identify as a feminist, and has a good handful of queer friends, disturbs me on multiple levels."

"But others come to Italy to stay. They set down roots and become part of the local colourful scenery. They are looked upon kindly by neighbours especially with regard to food and fashion and child-rearing (Oh but how can they know? They are foreigners!) Or they are regarded with deep and unfeeling suspicion. I know that when I moved here with my mixed children and mud-splattered car and unruly red hair and, every so often, a wild summer party, my neighbours decided that I was a hippie and a drug addict (WHAAT? HIPPIES DON'T WEAR DIOR). It was even whispered at my kids' school that I had had my four children with four different fathers. Can you imagine dealing with four exes?? Pluh-eeze."

In her eyes, Jeanne always felt the cruises were about all of you and not about her.

She was proud that her trips were like no other cruises, just as her Quackers were like no others."

"The goals you have in life, the major ones that is, are hard to grasp sometimes. They seem so far away, like we come so far only to go even further and it always seem just out of reach. Today, you need to stop looking at where the goal is, but where you are and be proud of how far you come. For example, my business, four years ago it was looking on the verge of death and we were pretty scared here. One by one new clients came in and every month we got better, then every year we became more stable, till finally this year we got too much work and needed to grow. We are still not where we want to be, but I will take where we are and proud of what we did to make it."
"There isn’t much of this going on in today’s world! There is a lot of fixin’ our thoughts on things that are none of these. You hear parents yelling at their kids for foul language, when the kids get it from their parents; you see people at work trying to get by with whatever they can, instead of working to the fullest of their ability; society is full of pornography – not only the hard stuff that wrecks marriages and families, but soft porn, watched on tv, seen at the movies, displayed on magazine pages until we become immunized to its effects; fidelity in relationships or marriages is thrown out the window – after all, if it’s kept hidden, it’s ok, right?; violence in video games, movies, loss of life taken lightly – we are honoring the horrors that our military face on a regular basis – things that mess with their heads for the rest of their lives; bodies are thrown from one lover to the other for instant gratification; babies are ripped from their mother’s womb, deemed an inconvenience from a sexual act that most likely should not have taken place anyhow; deceit is prevalent all around as times are hard and people fear for their survival, yet refuse to let God handle it all; lying is used to get us out of anything we don’t want to deal with; rage runs rampant from the highways to our homes. The list goes on and on…."

"I saw this on Yahoo, April 30 1945 was when a great evil committed suicide rather than be captured by the Soviet troops that were closing in on the Reichtag and the Chancellor building. The German garrison at Berlin were contesting every block with the Soviets but there were more Soviets with combat training and far fewer Germans, the Germans fought with fanaticism born of fear and desperation, the Soviet reprisals against the German civilians were well documented when German troops earlier had recaptured some German territory in Vistula, the gang rape and executions were documented by photo's and survivor eye witnesses. The German troops fought to buy time for the civilians to escape and of the false hope of all the wonder weapons and reinforcements that were promised by Geobbels the propaganda minister.

The Moroccan one has coriander (cilantro) cumin, chilli flakes, black pepper corns, and the Italian has chilli flakes, oregano, onions flakes and garlic flakes and black pepper corns. The Citrus is just the zest of two lemons dried in the microwave and added to the rock salt then ground in my little electric grinder."

"Volume 16, released earlier this month, starts in Tokyo, where a foreigner called Judy is planning to get married to a Japanese lad. His family, and especially his grandfather, is opposed. Basically, the whole volume traces an arc towards her final acceptance by his family. But the clever bit is that the story echoes the relationship between Rita and Masataka Taketsuru, the founder of the Nikka whisky (of which more here). Taketsuru's marriage to Rita, a Scottish woman, was at first not welcomed by his family (or her's) but they lived out their lives together in Japan. The story of Rita and Masataka is introduced near the end of the manga and resonates with the modern couple's experience."

To be the first Venezuelan to win a Formula One race is a big honour and hopefully I will win more races in the future."

"Rhythm is a very good thing...until it is not. I have missed some very great bargains following that rhythmic “get the heck out of here” mall march in my head. Getting on a bad rhythm is different than a bad habit. A bad habit is a single behaviour that you repeat regardless of the knowledge that it is doing you no good. Rhythm is how we have learned to flow through our days we don’t think about it, it just propels us along developing a bad rhythm is easier than you think. Good or bad that rhythm you've developed is a comfort to you. I learned that way back in design school. White pillow, blue pillow, white pillow, blue pillow, is the subconscious calmer. The 'thing' in the room that you can't quite put your finger on that gives you a sense of peace and comfort. It does not matter if the material is ugly and hard on the eyes; gross pillow, ugly pillow, gross pillow, ugly pillow has the same calming effect as pretty pillow, cute pillow, pretty pillow, cute pillow. It is the rhythm that makes you feel good."

"And the other nice thing about letting go of the lifestyle and just loving GOD and others is that it tends to eliminate the gray areas that we Christians run into. Rather than looking at something and struggling over whether it's right or wrong, black or white, you're faced with this question of if whatever it is you want to do will be loving to GOD and/or loving to others."

If you consider the red dragon on the Welsh flag, it makes perfect sense that Arthur Pendragon - the “head dragon” - should have lived and ruled there.

The sooner we get off the reserve, the sooner they push the Land Management Agreement on us, & the sooner we accept these and start living in the cities or start selling our land then the agreements that were signed over a hundred years ago will be null and void. We as a people, with our Aboriginal rights and Treaty rights will cease to exist, and this would make the government really happy. So take these cuts for what they are an attack on us as a people. So pick up your pen or whatever and write a letter to the Minister of Health, write to your local MP’s these are just the cuts we can see, what about the ones that we won’t see until we have to see a doctor and need medication or worse a medical procedure and we have to shell out. Enough is enough! Let’s not sit back and be passive about these things anymore. If we let them get away with this we open the door for more, cuz if you give the government an inch they are gonna take a mile.

"We moved, we survived and now I split my time between London and Provence with visits to Australia whenever I can. If you ask me today where home is I will say France but whenever I am talking about London or Australia I will also refer to them as home. My children would consider their home to be in London although they are very comfortable in France and are true Australians. I have come to realize that home can be as many places as you want it to be. Our home in Provence has captured my heart – from the very first day I saw it I have been smitten. London was another matter all together; it was not love at first sight. London and all it's wonders has crept up on me. I would say that many years passed before I felt that London held a place for me... I was 'being' and 'doing'... going through the motions... but without a real sense of belonging... Now I feel engaged with the city and I look forward to my time spent there each year..."

"Quinoa (pronounced “keen-wah”) seems to be one of the hottest new food trends, increasingly showing up on restaurant menus, recipe sites and grocery shelves. But quinoa has actually been around for centuries and can be traced back to ancient Peru.

Yep, that’s right, quinoa grows right here in Colorado so it is another great option for CO Locavores."

"The current Alberta Energy Ministry’s policy is to consult with aboriginal groups when development has the potential to adversely affect traditional uses and their constitutionally protected rights to hunt, trap, and fish. The provincial government stands by their stance that is does not consult with First Nation at the preliminary lease-granting stage because there are many steps to go before tar sands development actually occurs. Currently, the government’s policy is to simply post lease sales online and not consult directly with First Nations."

"But rescuing the emperor is not enough. Ichiro soon realizes the only way to save the universe is to reach the Bridge of Heaven, located on the island of Hokkaido, the home of the barbarian Ainu. Only then can he hope to bring the sacred sword, the sacred mirror, and the sacred jewel together to restore the Emperor’s power and divine status. Assuming, of course, that he can defeat Taira’s naval forces and somehow close the demonic gateway through which the forces of chaos might escape to overwhelm everything. That, however, will require Ichiro to enter Yomi, the very domain of Death itself…"

"Viking design emphasized intertwining, sinuous shapes, usually detailing animals and often including people. The Vikings often incorporated legend into their art. The stave churches are a particularly valuable part of the Norwegian architectural heritage, and are considered to be of national and global importance. There are several types of stave churches but the common element to all of them is that they have corner-posts (“staves”) and a skeleton or framework of timber with wall planks standing on sills. These walls are known as stave walls, hence the name stave church."

It feels like someone is stabbing a knife in my ear drum and waggling it about a bit. It's felt like that for three days. It has given me toothache in a way that I don't really understand. It has left me deaf in my right ear and confused my sense of balance. But the cruelest trick is that the pain is ten times worse if I lie down. Which is making sleep tricky.

"rolls and table look-ups can get rather tedious at times. For a successful hit there are 2 die rolls (roll to hit, roll damage) and you have to look up the hit location on a table. That's not so bad, but for a critical hit there are 3 rolls and 3 tables to consult. Add in the math necessary for figuring actual damage by subtracting the target's toughness and armor and it all gets a bit much to handle for 6 pcs and 8 beastmen late at night."

"Having said all this, I wouldn’t want to push the similarities between the two films’ characters too far. There are also important differences. Elsie in The Prince and the Showgirl is less ambitious and rather more likeable than her 1950s male counterpart, partly because of Terence Rattigan’s great script, adapted from his own play The Sleeping Prince, and partly because Monroe herself gives the character so much warmth. You never feel that Elsie is on the make, trying to work out whether the Prince could help her career – whereas I do think there is this feeling occasionally in My Week with Marilyn. Colin had appeared to be falling in love with costume assistant Liz (Emma Watson), but he quickly drops her when it becomes apparent that Marilyn Monroe might be interested. Liz herself suggests to him that he sees a possibility of trading up, and he doesn’t deny this. I suppose another way of seeing this is that Elsie is really falling in love with her Prince, even if their hoped-for reunion in 18 months’ time seems likely to be just a dream – but Colin’s flirtation with Marilyn will just be one week out of his life, something for him to remember, and trade on, later. Redmayne is excellent at making Colin genuine and kind, but at times showing a hint of calculation below the charm."

"This is, of course, based on a Neil Gaiman novel (he’s also credited as producer). I am, mutatis mutandis, a fan of Gaiman’s work, and the writers of Stardust (Vaughn and Jane Goldman) have worked hard to ensure it sits easily within the canon. Gaiman’s schtick, to the extent that he has one, is to combine classic story themes and ideas with a modern, often knowing sensibility – taking them seriously but not often sending them up. But while it’s smart and funny, Stardust is really lacking in the darkness it probably needs to convince as a genuine fairy tale – much of the time it’s desperately whimsical, occasionally bordering on the twee. It should really be as annoying as hell and the fact that it isn’t is to Vaughn’s credit."

"The problem with the second statistic is that it is very clearly illogical. Agents earn their income from commissions on sales--i.e., they get paid only if they sell something. If agents sold only 1 in every 100 manuscripts they represented, they couldn't make enough money to keep their doors open--except maybe the disreputable ones who charge fees. (Nor, with so few sales, is it likely that trade publishers would be able to churn out over 300,000 new titles a year in the USA alone.) And imagine the work load, if for every success you also had to market 99 duds! No agent will manage to sell every single manuscript--but no agent could possibly remain in business with such a high failure rate."

"As I said, it was initially hard for me to envision a zombie novel as a romance. However, either Marion’s writing changed my perception or love really does affect us all – living or undead. Marion can relate to our uncertainties about a romantic zombie. “I didn’t want to sanitize him into something I called a zombie,” Marion says. “You watch him kill people and eat people and do horrific things zombies do. There’s a germ of change in there, so you hear him give his distaste for things but this is what we do."

"The short story I read was The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster (which I believe is available for free online and in e-book format). I read it as part of my ongoing interest in dystopian and apocalyptic literature, and while Forster has some disturbing insights into future life that could easily be applied in today’s world, the story doesn’t have much in the way of plot or characters; it’s more of a platform for Forster to get across some of his ideas. It’s still worth reading, though, if you are interested in how authors envision the future."

"Like a lot of other bands, they straddle the line between pagan metal and black metal (if it's really a line at all), using very few folk elements. They play at a mid-pace for black metal, allowing their very catchy riffs to sink in (see especially ""Waldeinsamkeit""), while the drums never go into blast-beat territory, instead opting for a fast but steady pace with some fills. Most of the vocals are rasped, but there are some more melodic vocal styles in here as well. Which brings me to some of the surprises."
"Unfortunately, though, it's Sacha's head that catches the attention of the picky Baron (he was rather taken by his pronounced Serbian nose). Removing it with a pair of specially designed head clippers, the Baron and his lab assistant leave Nicholas unconscious on the side of the road next to Sacha's now headless body. Groggy and confused (he was out cold before his pal's head was chopped off), Nicholas wanders off to meet with Baroness Katrin Frankenstein, an eyebrowless vixen played by Monique van Vooren (Sugar Cookies). Yeah, that's right, he has an appointment to see the Baron's wife and sister (they have two kids together) at their castle. You see, before the head lopping incident, Nicholas and the Baroness were constantly running into one another. And since her brother won't impale her vaginal tract with his aristocratic penis anymore, she decides to hire the strapping stableboy as her new man servant/boy-toy."

"He stepped out of the car and looked skyward. It’s about forty-five degrees, sky full of stars, no clouds, but snow,” he thought. He peeled off his fingerless gloves before reaching into the air to catch a flake as it descended. He looked at it, but light was scarce. He checked up to see that the nearest street light was four houses away, then glanced again up into the starry night. He watched star after star disappear as if a black blanket was being pulled across the night sky, eventually leaving an empty ceiling. He blindly reached through the open car window while watching where the stars had been only seconds ago. He clicked on the spotlight that was mounted just above his side view mirror and held his palm in front of the beam."

"Talking to those who are already in the market will help you find out what’s a good rate for your work, as I’ve done. In my talks I’ve found that the going hourly is $25 (USD) and those with a network of clients earn significantly more. But if I were to come in and say $15 an hour, a very liveable wage here, would severely hurt everyone else and my future prospects. It would create the expectation that writing is only worth that much, which if I’m writing 1000 words an hour equates to 6.66 cents a word. I earn that for a short submission to some of the local publications."

Let me remind you, yet again, though it seems excessive, it is necessary to fully implement due diligence and determine whether someone really does qualify for a loan. The underwriter usually gets blamed for declining a loan, regardless of what the issues are and just recently something was written online about Real Estate Agencies requesting less strict underwriting guidelines. After all we have been through as a Nation, let alone the many homeowners who could face never owning another home, how could anyone request something like this?"

We punched holes in a milk jug and watched the water shoot out father from the bottom hole than the top hole. We also poked a hole in the bottom of one cup and the side of another to demonstrate that pressure is in all directions. I thought this would be rather simplistic, but I underestimated boys' fascination with water."

"Cap looks a tad cheesy, but his costume is impossible to film. The buccaneer boots will never work. Chris Evans seemed a bit restrained in this movie, the stiff personality of Steve Rogers maybe getting lost a smidge among all the goofballs on the team.

"This article in the nyt last month makes a good argument as to one cause. Agricultural subsidies are primarily directed towards a few crops, including corn and soybeans. This makes the goods derived from these crops, such as high fructose corn syrup, cheaper, while making other produce, such as carrots, oranges, etc more expensive. This means that healthier food ends up being a luxury good."

Seeing that Peter Sellers released it in 1957 perhaps someone should have a word with Steptoe and Son and tell them that only last year music copyright laws were extended from fifty to seventy years… The Performing Rights Society might also take an interest as they’re pumping it out like a Radio 1 Roadshow.

Of course, I got there as soon as I could. I have photos to share that I'll be uploading soon. What I will try to relate as well is the feeling of incredible love and hope that exists today for those on the forefront of fighting AIDS and discrimination for HIV+ people. What I learned about this disease, now in the 25th year since its discovery, shook me deeply and also made my eyes fill with tears of compassion for the people who live with this illness on some level daily."

"Nothing quite screams out ""Summer is on its way!"" more than the appearance of the Poinciana flowers. I've been very pleased to see these gorgeous red flowers this year. Last summer none of my Poincianas bloomed much at all, but that was probably as a direct result of the rather out-of-the-ordinary rain we received during our supposedly 'dry' season. Poincianas like the dry and they seem to bloom so much better when the dry season is very, very dry."
"I wouldn’t ever want to hurt them, but sometimes I wish I was the kind of person who would just do it upfront and not really care. But then again, that I don’t do cruel things like that is just about the only salvageable aspect of my personality, so I wouldn’t actually do it even if I could."
"Ideas alone cannot have any effect. They are simply information and evil people know this. That is why conditions are set up in the physical world to empower those ideas and hence trick the other person into believing them. And let me specify here again that empowered ideas are not ones that the evil people can present as some potent weapon being thrown at the victim from them. Evil people have no mental powers. Empowered ideas only means that lame ideas are presented at such time and in such a way as to find fertile soil. The victim is upholding beliefs together with changes to their body function, which occur simultaneously with the ideas presented, so as to make those ideas appear as powerful ideas. They are not. It is all about deceit and really a dramatic puppet show stitched together, a cut and paste exercise. With this in mind we can then appreciate that to generate barrier or resistance cells in the body (what doctors call cancer cells) there needs to be harmful ideas presented in the mind that are empowered because of the condition of the targeted person/ the victim; and for all that to occur when the targeted person is angry and hostile. When a person is angry and hostile they will hold a misguided volition with respect to those ideas as to struggle with them. However finding no clear and definable aggressor with which to struggle, which is their plan A, they go to plan B. In Plan B their volition becomes the desire to build a barrier or shield for protection against the mysterious aggressor. The theatre of war seems to be in the body, so the barrier that can be built can only ever be a cell barrier, which of course grow bigger and bigger the harder they struggle and fight until a mass is formed. This mass doctors call cancer."

"John and I talked several times before I could finally convince him to come out and see the house and the ongoing remodel. Over time, he told us stories about how special the house was for him all those years before; how it changed his life. He was only 28 years old when he designed it, as a “moonlighting” job. He described how he rocked his kids to sleep with his foot while he was drawing the plans, late at night. (Plans we now have, drawn with pencil on a rice paper of some kind.) John explained that the house changed his career, gave him the momentum he needed to start his own firm. He spoke very"
"As quickly as our snow came, it left and here it is January tenth and it's still fifty degrees outside. Tonight the kids played outside while I cooked dinner which doesn't even seem possible.

God I feel stupid when people talk about jet streams."
"Don’t take our word for it. Here’s what the late Richard Rorty, one of the most prominent post-modern philosophers of the 20th century, said on the subject:"
"I know what I need to do, in fact I have written it all down and have a recipe book to pull from ever meal that I need to create, cook and eat so that my body is fueled correctly. I know how to workout and in fact I crave it but with my current stress levels and lack of what I would call free time to get out there and bust ass, I am as I stated struggling to get back in the game as it were. Am I still riding my bike? Absofuckinloutly! that is something that I won't stop doing as its one of the things in life where I find pure joy but I am not in fact riding enough. I haven't ridden during the week in months, My only riding takes place on the weekend with a riding buddy and that's approximately 20 to 25 miles at a go which is as I said not enough."
"But more than the art, I was amazed to see the style of the women and men… all the fashion was amazing, and people are so elegant and confident, women are beautiful and men are so hot!! It’s too bad that most of my pictures from that time were lost when my notebook was stollen… so all I’ve got left is a few pics, but not enough to show some street style, so I just chose these about some styles I was wearing."
And mouth with myriad subtleties.
"After a bit, she wanted to go on the swings. Not the big girl swings but the baby ones. The one Ashlin was in last time we were there. Fine. Ashlin is staying in the stroller. I wasn’t allowed to push her though. Weird kid. Eventually she wanted to get out, so we did the wiggle, wiggle, wiggle dance to get her out of the too-small swing. The slightly wet sand under the swings was the next source of gravity, and she crouched down to grab a handful. And peed her pants."
"Naturally, I assumed she meant to say, ""Liberty won't HELP me clean."" The two girls had been working on cleaning their bedroom all. day. long. So I called into the other room, ""Liberty, help your sister clean!"""
I am a long way from this promised state.
"Where local policies contribute is property. As rent rises, so too do food prices. Supermarkets need to charge more to maintain inventory, and hawkers need to pay their stall rent. The practice of subletting hawker stalls is especially problematic: That’s when a stall holder pays maybe $700 a month for the stall, but charges someone $2000 a month to operate it. Wave at Holland Village, people."
"The most chaste daughter of Maharaja Drupada and partly an incarnation of goddess Saci, the wife of Indra. Maharaja Drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja. By his first offering, Dhrstadyumna was born, and by the second offering, Draupadi was born. She is therefore the sister of Dhrstadyumna, and she is also named Pancali. The five Pandavas married her as a common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. Maharaja Yudhisthira begot a son named Pratibhit, Bhimasena begot a son named Sutasoma, Arjuna begot Srutakirti, Nakula begot Satanika, and Sahadeva begot Srutakarma. She is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, Kunti. During her birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called Krsna. The same message also declared that she was born to kill many a ksatriya. By dint of her blessings from Sankara, she was awarded five husbands, equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She was married with the Pandavas during their exile in the forest, but when they went back home Maharaja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dhrtarastra. When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by Duhsasana to see her naked beauty, even though there were elderly persons like Bhisma and Drona present. She was a great devotee of Lord Krsna, and by her praying, the Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the name Jatasura kidnapped her, but her second husband, Bhimasena, killed the demon and saved her. She saved the Pandavas from the curse of Maharsi Durvasa by the grace of Lord Krsna. When the Pandavas lived incognito in the palace of Virata, Kicaka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with Bhima the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by Asvatthama. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband Yudhisthira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhisthira, but when Yudhisthira entered the heavenly planet he saw Draupadi gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet."

Some of the points that the Summer Matters site talks about are family time (though many families have two or are single-parent working and the summer doesn’t change that since the kids are still in the care of others during the day), childhood growth and development (which is currently ousted in favor of having children study more to boost standardized test scores) and the economy of seasonal communities (which really only matters if you’re among the top income brackets – we poor folks don’t really contribute much to the seasonal economy since we’re too busy worrying about budgeting this week’s grocery bill to plan a vacation to a touristy hot spot)."

"Enhanced eBooks are on everyone’s lips, yet there is no general consensus on what an ebook has to have to be considered an “enhanced” ebook.

One thing we noted during our stay in Ireland was how laid back everyone was. It was refreshing to note that no one was interested in getting us out of a restaurant or pub so that they could turn the table over. Throughout our journey we were never rushed and allowed to sit and enjoy our dinner at each establishment and were never rushed out the door. It was refreshing when you consider the United States where everything is about getting people in and out of a restaurant with no consideration of the flow of the meal.

I have a personalized aisle runner to mark the aisle and to protect my dress from the ground, my mother is going to help me decorate a wedding arch for the ceremony to take place under, and I made flower cones to hang at the end of each row of seats for an added bit of decoration to my aisle. I opted to make flower cones because they are different from standard pew bows, and I think they add a nice touch. They are also extremely easy to make and cost effective. For eight flower cones, I purchased eight sheets of cardstock at 25 cents a sheet, and four spools of ribbon, on clearance, for 97 cents each for a grand total of just under six dollars. My inspiration for making flower cones is from this site, although I ended up making my own subtle changes."
"It would be redundant of me to point out the obvious evil of the “modern” progressive crusade to save the world from itself, when the political correctness plague with which this movement is infected, is currently so pervasive at every level of society. It is an infection of psychological origin, a contagious mental illness, and it is spread by the main stream media through dissemination of certain key phrases that mutate into gross distortions of basic fact each and every time they are repeated. The carriers of this disease are those lonely souls who follow societal trends in order to fit in, and who desire nothing more than to be on the winning team. They make it a point to know all the buzzwords associated with the cause they support, but not the origin of the sound-bytes they parrot. They are quick to criticize opposition to their dogma, and resort to ad hominid attacks when confronted with irrefutable fact. They are unaware of their illness, and perceive anyone that disagrees with their view as uninformed, and generally all the more needful of their “help”."
"Budweiser is fit for a mates house party or at a club, fits with a guys image, little in terms of taste to offend or surprise the consumer and hard to spill so long as its kept in the bottle. Budvar is a little more reserved and almost an opposite in terms of setting. This would be more acceptable at a dinner table or in a nice pub with a few salty snacks to help it go down. This beer also has much more flavour, less carbonisation and is far more complimented when poured into a glass."

"No one should be more surprised that the Tories take money from rich people, who then get the ear of the Government, than that the Tories, and their Liberal clones, last week, pushed through a Budget that also favoured the rich, and further attacked ordinary working people. Society is not divided into just two Classes, but it is divided into two great ""Class Camps"", as Marx put it in the Communist Manifesto. That is the Camp of Capital and the Camp of Labour. The Liberal-Tories represent the former, and Labour should represent the latter. There is nothing wrong, or surprising, then in the rich, and the representatives of Capital, giving money to the Liberal-Tories in return for them pursuing policies in their interests, any more than there is anything wrong with workers, through their union subscriptions, or through individual subscriptions, paying money to Labour for the same reason."
"Though as this is taught to be possible to do, you are also said to likely bump into sinister beings who will try to mislead you from the path. These teachings explain how to transform yourself into a spiritual being and every spiritual being that exists is said to have done this work, have transformed themselves into beings of light. The sinister beings are also said to have made themselves into the way they are, have transformed themselves into beings of darkness. And when you call on a Master in the astral, the sinister beings are said to sometimes come to you, trying to pretend that they are the Master and try to mislead you. I have heard stories of this and people say that sometimes it is very obvious, like the sinister being is trying to look like the Master, but fails so hard to do so. Anyway, there are recitations that one can do which are said to get rid of any sinister being. This can be used to get rid of them and also to check whether or not you are encountering a spiritual being or if it is a sinister being. As sinister beings are said to disappear when doing these recitations, the spiritual beings do not."
"This just is not the way to follow up a classic film - it isn't done in the same visual style, it doesn't have the same level of acting, it hasn't got ONE SONG in the whole thing, and it's more likely to provoke nightmares than wonder. Fairuza Balk plays it more like Indiana Jones than Judy Garland, and she's acting alongside special effects 75% of the time. Running through some poppies would probably have helped the situation."

It dawned on me that they would have many thousands of life experiences without me. Until that point, I thought I would be part of every aspect of their lives and see and feel everything they did. It came as a rude shock when at 5 they were already, in a sense, on their own and experiencing life without me. It was at that moment I knew that my role had changed. I was simply a caretaker to watch over them as they did their own growing into adults."

"The traffic light and the traffic policeman is a common sight on every crossing. Oprah Winfrey, when she visited India recently and travelled across Mumbai, and later between Delhi and Agra, wondered what they were for. The mystery is yet to be solved. It is somewhat like figuring out why there is a Queen in England. I believe they are there because it is a tradition to have traffic lights (four) and traffic policeman (one) – a convention, without which the city roads would look less like roads, and more like lanes or highways. In some parts of India the traffic cop cuts a sorry figure, being abused and ignored; at others he is an evil character, stopping vehicles randomly, for his ‘cut’. (A ‘cut’ is a type of a tax imposed in India; the concept of this tax cannot be explained in this article.)"

"Often when it comes to sex, we get in our own way (in our modern culture and society), because there is so much social judgment about sex. It can take YEARS for a person to let go of all their hang ups and actually discover their own individual sexuality. So if you’re the partner who has been worried about porn – perhaps it’s time for you to watch some (alone) to see if you actually do dislike it… or if there is perhaps something about it that works for you too! Once you let go of concerns or feelings of guilt &/or shame – you may find that it excites you too. If so – problem solved! If not, so what? We’re complex creatures, we’re not all wired the same, so there’s no guarantee that you will become a porn lover… but there are LOTS of kinds of porn, so perhaps there is a type that works for YOU."

"The first time was back in early September. I was meandering through the aisles, loading up on cake baking supplies and snacks for my son’s lunch box. His birthday was coming, and he had just started full-day school days. I was weepy as I was wandering, still in the thick of the “letting go” process. It was hard for me to stomach him being under someone else’s charge, and apparently it was hard for him, too, as he was exhibiting some spikes in bad behavior. I wanted to wrap him up and tuck him away from the world, but I knew that I would not be able to shield him from “real life” forever. It made my heart crack."

One night, I struck up a conversation with the person next to me and turns out, he was a Chicago Cubs fan just like me, and grew up in Holland, MI. I had actually been to Holland, MI for a collegiate cross-country race so we talked a little about the town, and what it was like for him to grow up there. One of the many great things about beer is that it brings strangers together."

"However, the day we moved in (Wednesday) was the day the stove top arrived. The workers were here converting the stove to propane gas while we were moving in. After the workers left the ""boss"" builder stopped by to inspect their work and the damn stove exploded. Like blue flame, the knobs flew off, and the boss about lost it (after he raced to turn off the gas from the wall). I was instructed not to use it until they could get someone out the next day to fix it. Next day came (Thursday), more workers in and I got the all clear that a gas leak in the line had been fixed and we were good to go. We ordered pizza that night because I was too tired from unpacking to cook. Friday was the inspectors day to stop by and check everything out. And what to you know... the farking stove exploded again. Bigger this time. With blue flame and smoke and the whole nine yards. More panic from the inexperienced homeowners."

"If and when recidivism studies are conducted, to the extent unemployment is a major risk factor for recidivism, it's possible vocational programming may be as or more effective than drug treatment at reducing future crime: Right now we just don't have the data to tell. But since the two most important risk factors preventing reentry success are difficulty finding employment and drug use, to the extent vocational ed helps overcome the first of those barriers, it's likely reducing recidivism even if the studies haven't been done yet to calculate how much."

"It was spring again. William leaned on the balustrade of his terrace and looked out at the Pacific. Frangipani bloomed in stone urns on either side of him. Fifty yards ahead, and almost at William's level, a seagull floated in the air. William watched it fold its wings and swoop down toward the village dump. Then his attention was attracted to a dusty black car that had emerged from the village and started up the road toward the villa. A plume of dust rose behind the car. Presently William could hear the engine laboring. The car disappeared behind a clump of pines, reappeared in the road directly below the terrace, and came to a stop. The driver got out and ran around to open the rear door, and Mrs. Twett emerged."

Getting the plan off the paper it’s written on into the actions needed to make it a reality is one of the most difficult things to do, yet funny enough, the simplest! What you do is act.

It very frequently makes amendments or alterations. It appears, therefore, to be more consistent with the Dignity of the Queen, that even if Her Majesty approve of the Treaty as it stands, Her Ratification should not be given, until it is certain that the President has been authorised by the Senate to give the Ratification of the United States.”"

He just lay on his back tossing his head back and forth and whimpering softly. He had no energy to drink so every two hours I had to coax him to take some milk from the bottle and then slowly pour more into his mouth bit by bit."

"As I try to sum up 6 weeks of God’s glory into one letter, so many emotions and thoughts fill my mind and my heart. I wish I could bring Cambodia back with me. However (that being impossible), I hope to bring what I have learned back with me to share with others. My time there was so sweet and it was great to see all the work God is doing among the people of Cambodia! I went with a team of 7 other Americans (all in their 20s) from all over the United States. We met at training a week before departure, and spent that week together getting to know each other and getting to know God’s heart even more. We started off as complete strangers but 6 weeks later, saying our good-byes in the airport, it felt like we were saying good-bye to family. Each of these wonderful people has such a heart for God and a heart of servitude. It was amazing to see how each of them was seeking after God on their own, and together as a group."

"Titanic was a ship of supremacy; the classes of human race were divided according to the money they made. No third class passengers were allowed to be on the deck where the first class passengers were lodging. Even the staircase, which led to the first class decks where guarded to ensure no third class passengers sneaks in to satisfy their curiosity. This was the ultimate rule, no two cross cultures were to mingle and this was solely based on the preference of the high society."

"Needless to say, I was so wrapped up in the evening’s events that I forgot to take any detailed tasting notes, but the 12 Year Old immediately took me back to our Bowmore tasting on the coast back in January (this has some more in-depth tasting notes). Smooth and with incredibly well-balanced flavours, the 12 Year Old contrasted with the richness of the evening, with its savoury wood notes and a hint of peat on the finish. The 15 Year Old (Darkest) was much sweeter and heavier, with hints of raisins, almond and darker wood notes."

I wanted to steer clear of the modern, Abrahamic, Western religion in these posts and instead focus on traditional, ancient, forgotten religions as my focus was historical. After reading more, I personally think the bringing in of children into this matter is a very modern phenomenon."

However, reading takes some getting use to. I find it oddly hard to hold and I keep accidently clicking the next-page buttons. I’m frustrated by not being able to easily flip back to reread or flip forward to see the length of a story. I’m also constantly babying it: cleaning its screen, wrapping it up, keeping it away from water, etc, etc."

"I knelt and broke down in front of the beautiful image of love which was the witness of many of our promises and words of honor. Offering her the fragrant bunch I whispered to her in a trembling voice, “My love has found her morning and is in your arms. The time has long gone when I could repay her for what she gave to me. I offer you my gift of love that was meant for her, I bring to you those flowers that remained as buds while she waited for them to bloom.”"

I have also recently discovered Pinterest (yes, I know I’m a bit behind), which is serving me well as far as a procrastination station goes. And there’s only one week left of classes! The graduates are frantically pulling together their Keystone projects and presentations, which I look forward to seeing next week. All ending with commencement!"
"The unsurprising announcement that the Board of the World Bank had voted in favor of the American candidate, Jim Yong Kim, presents an opportune moment to reflect upon the soft power structures that shape global public policy in the early 21st Century inside the UN system and beyond. It is necessary to draw a distinction between Mr. Kim’s substantive qualifications and the procedure by which he was selected. Substantively, although lacking in either financial or diplomatic experience, Dr. Kim is in certain respects an interesting choice because of his lifelong dedication to improving the health of the very poor in the global South, as well as his training in medicine and PhD in anthropology. He has had extensive relevant experience on the ground, and in working with NGOs (he co-founded the widely admired Partners in Health) and in institutional settings (for some years he directed the HIV/AIDs program for the World Health Organization) and has been president of Dartmouth University for the past three years, although stirring controversy during his brief period of administrative tenure. It may be still wondered whether Dr. Kim understands sufficiently the economic dimensions of World Bank policy to enjoy the respect of the professional staff, and might have been more appropriately chosen to head an enhanced program of the Bank devoted to health and poverty. Overall, still, the substantive case for the appointment is relatively strong, although the two opposing candidates, both former finance ministers of developing countries, certainly had equally impressive substantive résumés and ethical profiles, and were plausible choices for this position."

"We got into the examination room and she did great looking through all the various devices and doing what she was told. Then came time for the eye drops. I had attempted to prepare the staff about Katie. When I called to make the appointment I had told them that she has autism and that she does not like having her face/head messed with. I TOLD them that putting in the eye drops to dilate her eyes was going to be an issue. “Oh don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” Well, you haven’t dealt with MY kid. When we arrived at the appointment, I reminded them, “My daughter has autism and she doesn’t like having her face messed with. The eye drops are going to be a problem.” Again, “Oh, don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” *sigh* When it came time for the eye drops, I told the assistant, “Katie has autism. She does not like having her face messed with. This is going to be a challenge.” “Oh, it will be fine. I work with kids all the time.” What happened next was straight out of a time passed where they tortured patients at hospitals… They laid her back in the chair and I could see her beginning to panic. Then, the assistant came to stand over her and tried talking to her. The hands came up to the face and the yelling/crying began. Katie is a very vocal and verbal child. She is FULLY capable of relating to those around her how much she dislikes a situation, and she did just that. I stood back and watched in absolute horror/vindication. I tried to tell them! I mostly stood by to see the man struggle with the situation, but I finally took pity on him and I went over to help by holding her hands down. I told her over and over again, “Let the man do his job. You need to have these eye drops to make sure your eyes are healthy.” All the while getting louder and louder. She was also getting louder and louder. I can only imagine what the people in the other exam rooms were thinking. Now, since her hands were pinned down, she scrunched her eyes up. The poor man (kid really) tried to get the drops in. He had us go out to the waiting room while the drops did their stuff. Poor Katie was all red from crying and she was all sweaty from the stress the whole situation had caused her. But, she was happy to be done with it all and enjoyed looking at all the glasses. After about twenty minutes, the man (kid) came back to check her eyes… We had to try the drops again. The first go round didn’t take. *FUCK*"

"I wanted to concentrate on all the good things I have in my life - the wonderful friends and family, the great places I have been and also the simple pleasures of my life. And I couldn't go past mentioning my beautiful husband Kevin. Most of you probably know that Kev and I met after he responded to an ad I placed in the Connections section of the local Sunday paper. That was 17 years ago this April. He was one of over 200 respondents and he was my 17th date (I am nothing if not persistent!). I first met him when he came to my place for a coffee - not the wisest thing to do, but my brother Adam was lurking in the background. He knocked on the door and Adam welcomed him and handed him a beer. Kev said later that he was desperately hoping he was at the right house (grin). We chatted for a few hours and I headed off to a nursing night shift. After that it was just one of those things. We kept ringing each other and catching up and six months later we were living together. He was nothing like the man I imagine I would spend my life with, but at the same time he was everything I needed. He was (and is) calm, kind and genuine. There is no pretence. He says what he means and doesn't tend to sugarcoat things. Most of all he loved me for all my faults and foibles - he never (and has never) asked me to change and he wanted the same things from life that I did (and still does)."

My mother lost my father when she was 27, and she taught both my brother and I that we should know how to do certain things for ourselves. I know how to change my own tire. My brother was admonished with ""No woman ever shot her husband while he was washing dishes."" But my mother was disappointed that I didn't enjoy many of the foods that she did. (If ground beef, chicken breasts, and cream of mushroom soup were made illegal tomorrow, she'd have a difficult time making tomorrow night's dinner, put it like that.) She was also highly critical whenever I did attempt to help--I could never stir fast enough or slice thinly enough.

"After three years of searching, and now 21 years old, I still had not found what I was looking for. I heard about a course called Silva Mind Control, which was invented by Jose Silva. I took a friend along with me and we signed up for the course. I had no idea what I was getting into, but the flyer that I had looked at promised me that I would have the ability to diagnose and heal those who were sick. We were told to lie down on the floor and visualize a workroom. Then we were told to create imaginary counselors to help us in this workroom. My counselors were Jesus, Curly, of the Three Stooges, and the Lone Ranger. LOL! I figured that each of them could be trusted. Much to my amazement they would appear with me in my imaginary workroom. We have discussed some of what this is in the pages of this book.

"I wish I could say that the Zan-Gah stories are completely accurate, but my approach was not primarily archaeological; it was humanistic. Zan-Gah is about courage, brotherhood, and compassion, among other things. Were prehistoric people compassionate? I doubt it. Nevertheless, I tried to be accurate where it counted. I researched slings and hand fishing. I researched prehistoric twins, discovering that in some early societies twins were terribly frightening and killed immediately—and so was the mother (not the father). That information was important in the development of my plot. I had never actually been inside a cave, so I visited Onondaga, one of the world's great caves (my state of Missouri is famous for them), and was overwhelmed by the experience.

"A Dominar in the Skorne Empire who rose to power through politicking and corruption, Rasheth is atypical of the Skorne as a people. The Skorne generally follow strict codes throughout their lives, almost all of which center around self-denial and drawing strength from pain. Rasheth, though, is not a fan of any of that malarkey, and lives to indulge himself. Having taken control of his house through shady deals and well-timed assassinations, Rasheth is in a position of great power in the Empire. His house has the best and most effective titan breeding methods in the entirety of Skorne society. This has allowed Rasheth to grow fat and rich. So much so that he can no longer move under his own power, and is carried everywhere by a team of agonisers. The only thing that has stopped any of the other Skorne Tyrants and Dominars from moving against him is his effortless mastery of the Skorne magic of mortitheurgy. No other Skorne even comes close to rivaling his control of the arcane, and so he is safe, and free to grow as hedonistic and as wealthy as he can."

Their wedding is set, as is Geeta’s to Dr Ravi but of course the path of true love never runs that smoothly and there is still the confusion between the two sisters to sort out. Although Raka tries to save the day, in the end it’s Geeta with a little help from her sister who proves that anything a Bollywood hero can do, a heroine can do even better.

"Only acceptance can be asked of you, for what you are is certain. It is set forever in the holy Mind of God, and in your own. It is so far beyond all doubt and question that to ask what it must be is all the proof you need to show that you believe the contradiction that you know not what you cannot fail to know. Is this a question, or a statement which denies itself in statement? Let us not allow our holy minds to occupy themselves with senseless musings such as this."

And in South Africa the PRAAG representatives undertook to contact the foreign correspondents of Swedish newspapers and keep them updated of events.

"The secret to the success of both movies, of course, is that they aren't really ""Arabian"" at all. What they are, in fact, is Arabesque -- an elaborate fantasia on the mere idea of the tales of Scheherezade, decorated with the filigree of genies, evil wizards, fabulous monsters, dauntless heroes and pure, chaste maidens in mortal peril."

"About 4 and 1/2 years ago, Marty and I were living in San Diego, CA. We were stationed there, while Marty served in the US Navy. My Dad was living with us, at the time. I got sick. Not just a little sick, like wretchedly ill, I just want God to take me NOW, kind of sick. I thought, I had a stomach virus, but a couple of days in and no one else in the house was sick. I had a fever, headache, chills, stomach ""issues,"" etc. I literally laid on the couch for days (thank God my Dad was with us to take care of Eli and Julie). I was officially out of commission. There was a long series of events that led to me being seen at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. We had to fight with the insurance to get me in, because I was supposed to be seen by a civilian doctor, but couldn't get in anywhere. Turns out I had a severe case of pneumonia. Doctor's wanted to hospitalize me. I said, ""No, just give me something strong and send me home."" I had suffered at home for days, anyways. Went home got better, life moved on."

It tells you everything you need to know about the Palestinians that they are the oldest existing “refugee” group in the world! Israel has done what any sane nation would do. It built a huge wall to keep them penned up in Gaza, controls the West Bank, and maintains a strong defense on their northern borders with Lebanon and Syria."

"But this is an image I am willing to be stuck with. In fact, I’d much rather you think of me as the mean mama than for you to think that my child is crazy or insane! Which is why I’m OK with you thinking I am mean for not giving him a piece of cake the size of a baseball, or as many candies as he can manage to eat throughout the time at the party. I’d rather you think I’m mean now than have you thinking he’s crazy later because he’s literally bouncing off the walls and being one of the rudest, most impertinent little children you’ve ever seen. I’d rather you think I’m a mean mama because I don’t allow my little girl to run around the room full of people “harmlessly” playing tag with another little girl. Better to think me a mean mama than for you to think she’s insane as she literally looks drunk and crazy and then can’t stop herself and could even end up hurting another child later. Better to think me a mean mama…"

Daddy and I have decided to start several traditions to honor you at Christmas each year. We let Caleb and Joel pick something from World Vision to use your Christmas money toward. This year Joel chose to buy 5 ducks for a family, and Caleb chose to help orphans. Your brothers talk about you often -- every day -- and ask about Heaven a lot. They both miss you terribly and looks forward to seeing you again one day. As a family we are also giving money to a missionary couple in Indai who work with slum children and to Samaritan's Purse Children's Heart Project which raises money to fly a child and 1 parent to the U.S. for life-saving heart surgery.
On to Monday morning at the OB's office. Still feeling fine and only minimal spotting (all of this was only when I wiped) no aches, pains, cramping etc. They took us in and said ... okay, everything looks great! We'll get the doppler out, find a heart beat and go from there."" Cold, and nervous they squirted the jelly on my belly and began. With my eyes closed and hand clenched around Charles' I prayed and prayed ""Lord, give us a heart beat, a strong, strong heart beat. Put our minds and hearts at ease and get us out of here!"" Well, the midwife said... ""yeahhh probably that uterus"" no worries, we'll getcha an ultrasound!"" She had us wait in the waiting room where I began crying... remember, we had prayed for a heartbeat. We wanted God to show us that first thing so we would have our minds at ease... ultrasound was next, and almost last resort."

"We are studying the American Revolution in my classroom. I wanted to show my students how the colonist felt over paying taxes to a distant king, so I staged a reenactment. First, I gave all the students some M&Ms in a cup. Then I appointed a student to be king and two to be tax collectors. I told all the students wearing red to raise their hand and asked the ""king"" if he wanted to collect taxes, M&Ms, from the students wearing red or not wearing red. The fun really began when the ""king"" made up more new taxes. He imposed a Girl Tax, Glasses Tax, Sibling Tax, and so on until their cups were almost empty. I will admit it got rather noisy with all the protests from the tax payers. The students were outraged! This set the stage for a lesson on the real taxes imposed on the colonist."
"I really wish I had brought my camera to school on my birthday. My darling (and very sneaky) 6th graders found out it was my birthday, and they threw me my first ever surprise party! They all hid under their desks after we came back from lunch, and they jumped out and yelled ""SURPRISE!"" They even brought cake and presents!! My favorite part was the sweetest handmade card they presented to me after the party. It started out as just one folded piece of paper, but more kids wanted to sign it so they stapled more paper onto the back. The notes my students wrote me almost made me cry! They were all so sweet."

Tammy got a phone call a few months ago from a company calling themselves Yellow Pages saying that they had a refund for us. Before she could ask any questions they informed her that I had signed up for advertising services (we're sitting on a domain name for a possible side business when we're retired) from them but that I was canceling the remainder of the services and that they needed to know where to send the $500. They asked her a series of questions and recorded her answers before transfering her to another telemarketer who began to explain the contract she'd just entered into. Say what? Tammy made it clear to them that she didn't sign up for anything and called them on the scam they were engaged in.

The set includes a variety of oval-shaped frames, and let me tell you, they make putting together a card such a snap! To make this card, I printed the frame on white cardstock, then layered it on to a piece of the hot pink cardstock. I then added a hot pink oval to the center, where I stamped the greeting in Versafine black ink. The patterned papers are from my scraps stash. I used one of my border punches by Fiskars to liven up just the corners of the polka dotted paper. In keeping with the challenge, I added a little floral and ribbon embellishment, with a pearl-topped hat pin tucked into the center of the ribbon behind the flowers."

The above policies need to be adapted with great insight to the specific circumstances of this country. In particular it is necessary to consider the dual nature of the South African economy and to match consumption patterns to local production capacity. This consideration supports the first of the above New Economics principle and runs counter to the 'neo-liberal' wisdom of the globalisation process.

"I remember a time when I was pretty small that she made corsages of violets. She would drive out on the rural roads and pick the violets. Then she would bring them home and bunch them and dip them in a preserving wax and pretty them up with bows. Then she would drive the long distance to a well-known ballroom dancing hall and there, on the street outside, would sell the tiny bouquets to the gentlemen for their ladies. (She did not know it then, but many years later she would be one of those ladies.)"
"Well, unless he’s Bernie Madoff, he’s not being picked on in any meaningful way at all, except that the President has (rightly) noted that the peculiar incentives of Wall Street, combined with a lack of regulation and, um, morality (my word) led to the collapse of the global financial system, and lots of people had to bail Wall Street out. Kinsley’s friend may not have caused the crisis, but neither did I, and yet Republicans in this country seem to be saying that the only people who SHOULDN’T have to chip in to knock down the deficits that came out of that collapse, two wars that were bought on credit, a Medicare benefit that was charged as well, and tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the top tier of earners in this country is…that same top tier."

"McCormack’s understanding of Barth accounts for the objections that Van Til and subsequent evangelicals propounded regarding Barth’s account of scripture. McCormack answers Van Til’s allegation that Barth “espouses a subjectivism in which human faith is the condition of the Bible’s becoming the word of God.” While not resolving all tensions for evangelicals that are committed to a classical account of metaphysics and the historical Anglo-American account of Enlightenment epistemology, it creates space for dialogue between evangelicals that have divided over Barth’s proposals."

"Put Aristotle’s and Steiner’s logic to work, though, and you have a far more useful tool. Take the status quo, and then imagine an opposite that’s just as bad as the status quo, but for the opposite reasons. That makes you think about just what it is about the status quo that’s problematic, to begin with; once you’ve identified the problems, it challenges you to consider the downside of going to the opposite extremes; and once you’ve identified the spectrum of possibilities, it leads you to explore many points along that spectrum, in search of the range of options that offer the most benefits and the fewest drawbacks. It’s far less simple—or simplistic—than going to the opposite extreme; it also works better in the real world, where hard binary oppositions are a good deal less common than muddily complex issues in which moderation is inevitably a better strategy than extremism."
It’s been said that we notice faults in others that we are most guilty of because we are more aware of them. I guess this is a form of confession because I find myself in the passive voice many times when I write and then I must go back and rewrite. How much easier it would be if we made ourselves aware the passive voice and wrote the first draft in the active voice. It would certainly save a lot of time.

"There has tended to arise the idea, from Leninism, and more particularly Luxemburgism, that the creation of Trades Unions is a symbol of the fact that the working class is a revolutionary class, whose conditions of life spontaneously generates a class consciousness, and that it is this class consciousness and the automatically arising collective and solidaristic organisation, which is the basis and form through which the new forms of property under Socialism are established. But, a reading of the programme set out here shows that conception is false."

When a customer comes into a strip club, the first place he usually stops at (besides the ATM machine right outside the club) is the bar. It's a transition for the customer. He is mentally adapting from the outside world to the inside of his carnal desires. The bar gives the customer a chance to take a breath, relax and form some sort of game plan in his head before venturing out to the floor filled with plastic shoes, glitter and g-strings."

Do you sit there, declaring what’s bullshit and what’s not? Do you call the man on his shenanigans? Or do you sit back and allow the insanity to take hold, to seep through your every pore and infect you with the oddity of pure sense. Not an ounce of this picture is coherent and yet you never question. Once the claws are in, you let it drag you along, smacking your head against the sidewalks of ‘irrationality’ and ‘Oedipal complexes’.

There was a woman who made it possible for me to find the place where my soul fully lives, if only for a week a year. She saved me many, many times and she never even knew it. She helped me understand what it was like to live completely and fully, if only for a little bit at a time. I am 'in place' there."

"You were given a side, to Ipasa (Pass) or Ibagsak (Fail) the President’s first year as the commander-in-chief of a country struggling to accept the reality of its extreme social, political, and cultural poverty. The debate, wherein arguments are presented, raised in the form of contentions, supported by credible and reliable facts, opinionated with an understanding that emulates critical thinking; a debate WE were expecting that DID NOT occur."

"These are their tactics of gaining support through lying and making members of their community believe them through the propaganda they so actively spread. This is starting to sound more and more like a certain violent doctrine I know of. It’s very easy for us to gather our members in each division around the country and attack members of any community. We are part of a grass-roots movement so large and strong, anything is within our capabilities. There is nothing out there that can match our strength. But we chose not to go down this route. The police are not at our demonstrations to protect us. They are there to make sure no harm comes to our counter protesters. But one promise I can make is that if any of our members are attacked like this again, we will act."

"Yes, I was still playing with my Silhouette too, so made my framework for Tabia on this creating a 'special place' for Tabia to reside within the bubble circle all of which I had also made myself. This circle of circles is in fact two layers so that I could add the coloured 'bubbles' neatly. These ones were actually made from colouring Promarkers onto acetate. The reverse is actually ever so slightly different (a couple of extra cut out bubbles so it is just that little bit more interesting on the back than it otherwise might have been - I know, I am mad!!!) The logic being of course, that as it dangles it will rotate slightly so didn't want it to be too boring on the back."

"However, in my opinion, the film's real star was Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault. His role is like the other roles, only more so. A self-proclaimed corrupt official, Rains' Louis sparks scenes with his sly wit. He could have been a villain but in Rains' hands, you can't help but love him."
"Next is the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. I read the books and listened to the radio plays and loved them both but for different reason. I’ve chosen these books for their sheer delight in the English language, general silliness and its cast of crazy characters."

Sure there are lots of ramifications. If you send the illegals home, it will have an impact of prices. If you don't send them home, you basically saying - It's OK to exploit them as cheap labor. If your saying make them all citizens, I'd ask who the hell is going to pay for it? And if you say - the government I'm going to smack you upside the head with a 2x4.

"Some people are lucky enough to end up in a satisfying and rewarding job that they really enjoy but for others wage labour is a grind; a daily misery that has to be endured. For such people the prospect of self employment has the appeal of making you ""your own boss"" and offering some (albeit limited and largely illusionary) freedom. But going into business, which is what becoming self employed involves, comes at a price. Hard decisions will have to be made regarding ones relationships with other members of society and it's not easy to be an entrepreneur and a nice guy. Another alternative is to get enough money together to buy your way into the landlord class, and the same tough decisions will have to be made. Of course not all business types and landlords are complete scum. Indeed many do their best to follow their chosen path in life and at the same try to give everyone a fair crack of the whip; there is after all such a thing as a good landlord. Clearly not in that category are the greedy, heartless swine who have decided to make a fast buck by evicting tenents in order to re-let the property (at hugely inflated rents) to Olympic tourists."
"And on top of the fear and the hurt, I’m just plain pissed off. Like I want VERY BAD THINGS to happen to him. Which is horrible of me and the second I start thinking that way, the second I am reprimanding myself for being such a bad person to think like that. I want more to happen to him than just being without a vehicle or a phone. Because, seriously, if he would just get and keep a freaking J.O.B. he could make that happen for himself. No. I want him to suffer. I want him to feel heartbreak. I want him to be lifted to the top of the world and then thrown into the ground. I want Karma to come kick his scrawny little ass for EVERYTHING he ever put me through, up to and including this latest fiasco. A lot of me has faith that this will happen because that’s just the way things go with me. A very dear friend of mine says it’s because I have a REALLY strong energy force. I don’t know about that, but I DO know that people who hurt me get hurt. Bad. And 9 times out of 10 they end up regretting doing me wrong. And you know what? I FORGIVE them. I do. Not because they got theirs and we’re even, but because over time I recognize they are human and make mistakes. But THIS? I don’t see myself forgiving him for a VERY LONG TIME."

"To kick off the campaign, the parents organized a time for me to come and talk to Countryside Elementary Kid’s Council in the morning. After this, scripts were written for each school for morning announcements to spread the word within all of the schools. We also designed posters for each school to put up in the main entrance of their school. The announcements to remind students to “turn of lights behind you” are made every morning during the week. Along with this, each elementary student got a Tolby light switch decal and kid-centered action guide. Woofta! With all this great work we were able to bring students attention to the simple energy saving action of: Turn off lights behind you."

The game is slated to be kicked off at noon CT. The Saints will then have their bye in week 11.

And yet, the author herself came from such a background, earning a bachelor's degree from Harvard and an MFA in fiction at Columbia. Although the book is clearly semi-autobiographical, I almost wish the author had written it as a memoir so I had a better sense of where the line between fiction and reality lies in this work. But sometimes truth is even a stranger tale than fiction."

"Otaku are a curious lot. The domestic, Japanese brand of zealousness is legendary, truly something marvelous and/or frightening to behold, as fervent devotion to favored idols, seiyuu, anime/manga characters, bands and other celebrities goes far beyond mere “fanaticism,” which is perhaps the closest Western analogue, although not nearly the same level of intensity. When scandal breaks, the otaku community erupts and the colossal outpouring of visceral response -be it bitterness; resentment; jealousy; or other form of discontent- can spread like a metastasizing, virulent contagion and the effects can linger long after things have technically “blown over.” They can be militantly hostile in defending an icon/franchise and are very outspoken if they feel industry professionals are not living up to perceived standards (Just ask Anno Hideaki)."

"That was my most shocking comet until 2007. That’s when Comet Holmes suddenly burst on the scene – and I mean burst. One night it was an incredibly dim magnitude 17 object visible only to professional astronomers and amateurs with extremely large telescopes – and neither the professionals nor the amateurs were much interested in it. Such faint comets are fairly common, and this one had been seen on repeated visits since 1892. But in just a few nights it was easily seen with the naked eye. Amateur star gazers were dazzled. It was a bright, round cloud in the same general area of the sky as Hartley 2 will travel through this fall. Yet it was farther away – out beyond the orbit of Mars and oriented so that from Earth we were looking right down the barrel, so to speak. That is, it had a tail, but the tail of a comet always points away from the Sun and in this case it was pointing directly away from us."

Meanwhile, black folks make up just 8.1% of Austin's population, but a whopping 28.1% of petty marijuana cases. Latinos are the only one of the three largest ethnic categories who are arrested and cited for marijuana at roughly their proportion in the general population. Whether the disparity is driven by race or whether race is a proxy for other factors - like police deployment decisions - I cannot say. But I don't understand why the number of marijuana cases should be rising, and I certainly don't understand why black folks would be targeted so much more frequently for enforcement. Don't kid yourself. There are a LOT of white pot smokers in this town."

"Just as much as it is about the family though, it is also the story of a country that is fading away. When Charlotte and Wilhelm return from Mexico to Berlin in 1952 to take up their responsibility of building up the new country, the dream of a uniquely German socialist state is still a heady one, an intoxicating vision of an ideal future. As the years progress though, we see the reality of East-German communism, the plastic cars, the crumbling buildings, the power shortages... While stalwarts like Wilhelm continue to believe in the system, others feel that the country has lost its way, some (like Alexander) hoping to leave it behind for good.

"One of the least known aspects of the GE Bt brinjal is its ability to cross with wild relatives or cultivated varieties. This is because there are no recent reviews in the scientific literature concerning species related to brinjal, and where they grow across Asia. This information is vital when addressing concerns regarding cultivation of GE Bt brinjal, because insect-resistance gives a selective advantage to the plant, increasing its ability to survive and reproduce. If the GE Bt brinjal cross-pollinates wild, weedy or cultivated relatives, the result is a hybrid offspring, which may grow more aggressively and thus become a problem weed, the report says."

"Director of Technical Quality, GRS Group Bill Tryon is Technical Director for Global Realty Services Group, where he is responsible for due diligence standards for environmental, property condition and seismic due diligence as well as construction monitoring. During his thirty years in the industry, Bill has developed risk management policies and procedures for one of the world’s real estate lenders and has participated with governmental agencies to refine policies and requirements. Bill first became involved in environmental due diligence in 1988, before the creation of current industry standards. As Chief of Construction and Environmental Services for a major real estate lender, he developed independent standards for the completion an evaluation of environmental assessment activities. In the mid-90’s he became a founding member of the Environmental Bankers Association. As committee chair for various committees, he worked to assure an in-depth understanding of environmental issues across the membership. More recently, he has consulted with the Small Business Administration and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding environmental policies, participated in the Environmental Protection Agency’s development of standards governing “all appropriate inquiry” and presented various topics at EPA Brownfield and other industry forums. During his involvement with the early development of due diligence standards to support early CMBS lending programs, Bill worked to refine broad industry standards to produce scopes of work more specific to lending risks, resulting in price reductions of nearly 40%. Additional cost reductions were realized by implementation of a “small loan” assessment. Bill’s ability to cut the fat away from standardized industry products helped control risks while reducing costs and creating a competitive advantage. In 1989, after California’s Loma Prieta earthquake, Bill became involved in the evaluation of earthquake risks associated with owned properties as well as the loan portfolio of a major real estate lender. Since no standardized approach to the evaluation of such portfolios existed at that time, he was forced to become familiar with the principles of earthquake risk assessment in order to develop appropriate corporate policies. As the market expanded, he extended his approach to portfolio analysis to include the evaluation of CMBS loans. It quickly became apparent that the industry and even many of the consultants involved in the analysis earthquake risks had a limited understanding of the variables which can significantly impact the conclusions of such studies. Bill adopted and defended criteria appropriate to a portfolio-level evaluation of risks which was eventually validated by ASTM International standards published in 2007."

"I had been healthier just before I caught the infection that put me back into acute mode than I had been in a long time. I went to a fund-raiser supper at the church for the first time in years, literally, and I did it without the wheelchair or the oxygen. So people saw I was alive and still wanting to be part of the church community. Maybe that is why I got cards, phone calls, prayers, meals, etc., but probably not. It didn’t surprise me how much it all meant to me. I hope I have been able to convey that in my thank you notes. And I hope to be encouraged enough by these acts of love to move toward keeping community a part of my life. After all, the church mission statement is: “Love God, Love Others, Serve the World.” And one of my favorite scriptures is Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,”plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”"

I’ve taken a liking to placing the infusion set in my upper arm. I like the different location and it causes no problem in cooler weather, but is slightly more problematic in warmer weather. Without sleeves, the site is often the victim of door frames, driver seats, sports bras, and stares. Yep- people stare. Some ask questions, opening a dialogue for some good old fashioned education. Or smart-ass responses."

"The above ""Trail Print dress"" has a lining that is cut very narrow through the hips, making the appearance of the outside seem blousier and more forgiving than it is in actuality on the body. This is a cotton dress so it is versatile for all seasons and easy to launder at home (still I only hand wash, line dry). Solid color versions are made of a substantial silk blend fabric and come unlined, without the same hip issues of the cotton version. Printed versions of this dress require sizing up for ample hips or dealing with spanx. The above is an 8 but I tried the 10 and it fit similarly with slightly more hip room in the lining."

There are some. Like–I have discovered my inner neatnik. I didn’t even know I had an inner neatnik. Compared to Mom, I still don’t. But let’s just say I’m acting a whole lot more domestic than I used to. All that was more or less to be expected, though. It’s going fine. But let’s be honest. They’re still adjustments.

(NIV)As parents, one of our values should continually be to get our kids to behave a certain way when we are not forcing them to do so. Our goal is that they would make wise decisions when we're nowhere around. Anybody can drive safe with a cop in the rearview mirror. It's on the open road that is the concern. Yes, I know your kid's an angel at their friends house and a pain in the rear at yours. I get it. I just mean that ownership, not compliance is our goal. If it isn't, I guarantee that compliance or fear won't work as a dating motivator. What will make a difference however is shared values.

"A propane grill or charcoal grill for cooking food when you no longer have power. This is great and makes the most sense because grills are portable. If you loose your home you could take your grill (assuming you have a portable one). I recently bought a grill. I’ve always had one because I love to BBQ, nothing taste better than food cooked on the grill. I choose a propane weber grill and kept my small charcoal grill. I did this for two reason 1. I may not always be able to afford propane. I keep two large fuel tanks, and many smaller propane tanks. While these are good for now and will get me through a year + without power. There may come a time when I can no longer afford propane. If that is the case then I have my portable charcoal grill. 2. I’ve stocked up on charcoal. During the great depression many people would go to railroad tracks looking for pieces of left over charcoal. Luckily, for me there are still train tracks where I live that transfer coal."

"We had a fairly quiet day on Sunday so I jumped straight into making some of Leigh's recipes. I don't have a lot of experience with pastry making although I do love eating it. Ready made puff pastry sheets are usually my preferred option for when the pastry cravings hit. I started with lemon and passionfruit tarts which used a sweet shortcrust pastry. The pastry was a breeze to put together although rolling it out after the resting period took me a while. The lemony filling required little effort and as I don't own any tart cases, I made mini tarts using a muffin tray to make the cases. They were really lovely with a wonderful tangy flavour from the lemons, just my type of sweet."

"During sleep, our brain releases inhibiting substances to prevent us from acting out our dreams fully, although we may toss, turn and even talk in our sleep. The feline brain works similarly. In laboratory experiments where unfortunate feline subjects have had their brains tampered with so that those substances aren’t released, the cats act out their dreams in full. Even laboratory-bred cats which have never hunted, or even seen prey, have been observed to ‘catch birds’, ‘chase mice’ and ‘bat prey’ in the course of their dreams."

"The book begins, like Well-Met in Kith’takharos, with a colour map of the region, an explanation of how and why the authors design adventures, and an outline of the scenario, which has 10 events or encounters. There are three different adventure hooks to draw in the players, depending on whether they played through the earlier scenario or are fresh into the village."

"Yesterday was much hotter than we have had in the past week. 97 degrees and muggy. When it is muggy and hot in my state, every business owner turns their AC down to 32 degrees. This is not fun for me. Anytime I go into a building I become a Popsicle. I literally freeze, so for me the hotter it is outside the more layers I put on in order to counteract the inside temps. It is easy for me to remove a top shirt or vest while in the car and pop it back on when I head into a store or business."
"Another communication problem: there's a hospital chain that is our main account. We are all set up to sign in and chart at all the hospitals in that chain. A couple of months ago, word came down-- 2nd, 3rd and fourth-hand-- of a new way to chart the dialysis treatments. It was, we were told, mandatory. Here's the problem: five different people told me five different ways to do this mandatory way of charting."

"The two beautiful hot dogs above are from Wayne's Chicago Red Hots, recently-ish opened on MLK here in Portland. Those dogs are the real thing: Vienna Beef hot dogs with the full complement of authentic Chicago goodies including pickle, tomato, onion, weird green relish, mustard and celery salt, all on the correct poppyseed bun. After several failed attempts to get a certain stepdaughter to bring Vienna Beef dogs back from Chicago, I've finally found a place to eat them."

"Recently I’ve asked a couple of you to remove spoilers from your reviews, and you kindly and graciously agreed, and for that, I thank you. Others of you refused to change a word, saying you stand by what you said. I did not ask you to change your opinion. I merely asked you to remove the spoilers, which did not merit the abusive reply."
"While many are familiar with the stories of uprisings led by Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey and John Brown, a significantly fewer number of people know the story of revolutionaries Charles Deslondes, Harry Kenner, Kook and Quamana who led a group of enslaved Africans toward a vulnerable New Orleans during the annual Mardi Gras celebration in hopes of gaining their freedom. That is about to change."

"Yes and no. Our bodies are just as much a part of who we are as are our souls. When we worship, we involve our bodies. The sacraments have physical components (water, oil, laying on of hands, etc.). Furthermore, there are instances where the body acts directly upon the will. At some point, an addict might no longer have any choice in the matter – he can no longer help himself. Some have suggested that this is what St. Paul was getting at in Romans 7:17: “As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.”"

"I didn’t get any sort of epiphany from solanin. Instead it was more of an affinity — I didn’t just relate to these characters, I WAS these characters, trapped, confused, unsure of how to move forward. The best thing solanin did for me was point out that I wasn’t alone, that I wasn’t actually failing just because I didn’t know where my life was supposed to go from here. It also reminded me that even when your lost, you can’t just stand still: after Taneda’s death, Meiko ends her months of wallowing by picking up his guitar and deciding to join his old band. Music isn’t her dream, not like it was for Taneda, but it becomes something for her to do, to focus on. She finds a long sought-after connection, and even if it’s not necessarily moving forward, it’s still moving, which is better than sitting round letting the toxins collect. It may have filled me with an undefinable feeling (friends I lent it to didn’t fare much better, returning the book with an uncomfortable look on their faces) but I’m glad I read this manga at the time I did."

"This is the topic that originally prompted me to expound on some general ideas about how Biblical literalism tends to go, and some of the problems with it. I’m not going to bring any pesky “evidence” or inconvenient “facts” into things here.

"While going through a large bag which contained her make up, a roach came out to say HI to me. I squealed, picked the bag up with 2 fingers, ran it through the house, and threw it out the front door. Oh HELL NO! My husband wants to know what I am going to say to her about the make up bag being outside. My first thought is 'If there was a roach in my bag I wouldn't want any of that shit.' So I said ""I'll tell ya what, when she pays me back the hundred or so dollars for the air mattress they ruined, I will replace her make-up."""

Elaine and Axel F narrowed it down to Frozen Peppermint Bouche de Noel and this one. Upon presenting these two final options to mom and dad I received the response: 'the whiskey one. When we see whiskey, we react.' The whiskey one it was."
"Seven conspirators line the streets, all in different locations, yesterday preparing to assassinate the Archduke. He was set towards city hall, and as the royal car approached Gabrinovic, he threw a bomb that bounced off of the car and exploded near the following car. The Archduke and his wife continued on to City Hall, and retraced their previous path after the ceremonies were over. This put them in the range of Princip. Amazingly the car stopped directly in front of him and he fired the two deadly shots."

"This is moving along fairly quickly. It helps that I love the yarn (Frog Tree Pediboo), and that most of the rows are stockinette, so I can read while I'm knitting (which I did this last weekend; Nook finally has my favorite Bujold books available, so I got a couple, along with Reich's latest ebook release, which I highly recommend, if anyone is looking for something that will make them think, and perhaps foam at the mouth, in a good sort of way). It's not a difficult or mind-consuming knit, but a fun one. I'm done with the striping, so now it's only the gray border to go. And I have a two-hour Senate meeting this afternoon, which should translate to some progress."

I love this polish in the bottle but on me it just doesn't work :("
"Also, the other part of the article, where the kids had to come home with permission slips to watch ""How to Train your Dragon"" but not for receiving the bible....ridiculous. There should have been permission slips sent home for the bible or any other religious materials that would be handed out. Has anyone noticed how violent the bible is? Or the things it teaches us that we are suppose to be doing...some areas in Leviticus (sheesh!)...should we not punish children then when they throw stones at each other on the playground? There is a reason children are not given grave details on the Civil War at such a young age in school....what is the difference?"
"Das Racists’ first two mixtapes, released in 2010, were perfect summer records. It was actually the summer of ’11 that found my circle of friends soundtracking warm, aimless nights with “Rainbow in the Dark” or “Hahaha, jk” and the group’s ironically-ironic careless attitude already feels nostalgic in the way that summer records do after just a few months. Now in the winter of 2012, we have the first solo mixtapes from Das Racists’ core MCs. Heems (Himanchu) has filled his first outing independent of the group, Nehru Jackets, with a lot more to discuss than his counterpart, though I may get around to a review of The Palm-Wine Drinkard eventually."

"But where did we begin? 3 1/2 years ago we bought our 1971-flat-roofed-brick-house on a wing and a prayer. We weren't the highest bidders, but I wrote a letter to the owners explaining why we wanted the house and what it would mean to our family (I hinted at our family challenges early last year when I started the Blue Velvet Chair blog if you want to have a peek). It worked, and they chose us. We knew the entire house was due a proper renovation and a chance for a new life - it had a super solid foundation to work with - fabulous space both inside and out. Let's have a look at what it was like when we moved in."

"During the semester, I am busy with students and other various runnings around in my life. I don’t get to print that often. I have three blocks (2 lino, 1 wood) ready for printing. I have recently discovered Akua inks. Good bye oil based, smelly, messy clean up inks! Hello eco friendly, water cleaning up velvety finished ink! I highly recommend this ink to anyone who prints for monoprints/monotypes and relief/intaglio. Since I have three blocks ready, I am gonna print the first color for all of them today since all need yellow. I used Akua Intaglio in Diarylide Yellow. It is a wonderful warm yellow, borderline a golden rod yellow shade."

"The surgery is now finished, and Sam is headed to the CICU for recovery. The Glenn portion of the surgery is over and looks pretty good; however, there is one tiny snafu...the vegetation next to his tricuspid valve has gone missing! Where is it? Nobody knows! If it left the heart, that means it went somewhere else in the body; possibilities include the extremities, the gastrointestinal tract, the lungs, or the brain. The brain would be the worst-case scenario. There is some concern that it went there because the oxygen saturation levels on the right side of his head were somewhat low. Now (of course!) that may mean nothing--lots of possible causes."
"Almost all of the rise in nonmarital births has occurred among couples living together.

"With a balanced throat chakra we “… tune into our own inner voice; it picks up our intuition and our spirit guides and angels.” This helps us tell the difference between our “ego” thoughts and our true messages and beliefs that come from within. Pg 143 Our intuition is not “an audible voice” but a subtle message. To increase your intuitive powers you will first need to be open to being an intuitive person. The second decision is to expect to be intuitive. “Expectation acts as a magnet for intuitive feelings.” 145/146. The third decision is to trust the feelings that you are opening to “because your intuitive feelings may not be supported by appearances or confirmed by others.” Pg 146 The fourth decision is “…to act on your intuition when it guides you.” “Making these four basic decisions – to be open, to expect, to trust, and to act on intuitive feelings, will create a direct conduit for your fifth chakra to communicate messages to you…” pg 146"
"Last week I spent five days in Nashville working on my first record with my producer, Marshall Altman. The first three days we were in pre-production. We recorded scratch tracks for 11 original songs (with the exception of Be My Vision which is a contemporary version of the Hymn with a brand new chorus). The process was detailed, trying and really fun. I had to fight for things I really believed in and learn where to let go. It’s probably a good exercise in life too, right? Good therapy."
"Water resources in the Middle East are subject to an unprecedented pressure which is threatening the populations of entire regions along with their economic activities. Population growth, migration, urbanization, and climate change are all exerting an enormous impact on these resources. In fact, over the last 50 years, the flow rate of numerous rivers in turkey, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan has plunged by 50 to 90 percent. And yet at the same time, the sustainable management of trans-border water resources is vital to provide for the requirements of agriculture, the need for clean drinking water, and for socio-economic development in general. It is key to avoiding human tragedy and to fostering the promotion of peace."
"God waited patiently for the right time for Christ to be born to bring about the new and perfect worship system where men and women will worship in “truth” and in “Spirit”. Even the apostle Peter struggled with these concepts even after he had first hand witness of what Jesus had said: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.(Joh 2:19)”."

"I've been working at SAINTS for almost three weeks and i am enjoying it, i find myself eager to get there and see everyone and get the work started."
"Nowadays, people shack up all the time. They are in no way distinguishable from a married couple, except by their lack of a license. (I would say they lack the lifetime commitment, but so do the married people, too, much of the time.) I say, why can't they have a lifetime commitment without the license while they're at it? Why can't they go by their local church, synagogue, or hippie guru and proclaim their lifetime commitment? Why in the world is it against the law for them to do this? Maybe they don't want the state to bother with them. What about that scenario is so terrible?"
"Later that night, Emmy Lou is getting undressed, knowing deep inside that Jonah Hex is alive. There is a knock on the door. It's the hotel manager with a message.

"When I woke, I could hear one of my guides telling me quite loudly to go for a walk. I’ve learned through experience to trust my guides and go with whatever they’re telling me because they’re always right. I splashed some cold water on my face, changed into some clothes and grabbed a quick cup of coffee to take along on my walk. I was staying at Marga Country Park, home of a magnificent estate built around 1870 and just below the estate were the ruins of an old Abby. The estate or castle, whichever you prefer to call it, was from the neo-gothic time period surrounded by lush gardens and the beautiful rolling hills of Wales. In the distance, nestled high on a hillside, you could see the ruins of a monastery. Now being a bit of nature person, I thought to myself what a wonderful place to go for a stroll and maybe, just maybe, a brilliant idea would come to me for my speech."

Out of those submissions, I have not accepted one."
I want to write a little something about what happened to me last week and how mark. helped fix it!
"This is something I’ve debated on and off with quite a few children’s authors. Some take a hard line and resist saying anything that could be construed as boasting. Others feel that Facebook, say, is there for the sharing of good news however big-headed it makes one look. One author I talked to this week resists social networking altogether, because she’s so careful of her public statements."

"Sometimes the way I learned growing up seems surreal to me, when I compare it to how most others spent their childhood. Like I lived in a different world, despite my physical proximity to everyone else. Sometimes (often), I still feel that way! It's such a radically different way of living than that of the mainstream that it's hard to reconcile the two. And I find myself frequently just really, really not getting why anyone thinks the traditional way of teaching small children is a good thing! Learning can be so simple, so flowing, and so much fun, if only parents and educators would relax, sit back, be ready to help if wanted, but mainly just let it happen. Children are remarkably good at learning! As the great John Holt said:"

"Vera Farmiga’s Higher Ground. I was so impressed and touched by this film about a woman’s life as a Christian that I’m still vexed I didn’t take the time to write about it extensively. Farmiga isn’t a showy director, letting instead the story take center stage. She stars as Corinne, a young woman whose faith grows stronger as she and her husband build their family and become part of a hippie-ish community of strong Christians during the 1970s and 80s, including the earthy Annika (Dagmara Dominczyk, below) with whom Corinne has a rich and happy friendship. For many of these years, her faith gives her a deep sense of self and identity."

"The Fling surpassed my expectations. I WAS expecting the felt work in my Scandinavian Rug class to be physically grueling. It was. (I am glad I did some training by making two natural fleece rugs on my own; plus all my gardening!) What I was not expecting was how easy everything else was and just how wonderful it would be to spend a week with people who all spoke felt. I also wasn't expecting to learn so much outside of class, though I should have been. I find fiber artists to be so much more willing to share and support than groups of artists in other mediums. For example, after the show and tell for Erma Yost's class I spoke with her about using some of my old woodcut blocks for printing on fabric. I have been wanting to try this for a long time, and Erma gave me many tips and showed me which paints she like to use. So through the wonderful rug class with Rod and Karoliina, visiting the other studios, show and tell nights, and conversations with so many other feltmakers I learned so much and I am filled with ideas of things I want to try."

Dramatic guest spots included both The Dick Powell Show and The June Allyson Show. She also had a failed TV pilot for a sitcom called “The Jane Powell Show”. Powell was also a regular guest on TV variety shows in Australia when she visited there to perform her nightclub act. She also had a one-off TV special in that country in 1964."

My boy acts less interested, but is a total sponge with knowledge. i'm sometimes surprised by the amount of information he retains when i don' even realize he is listening. He can often tell me the name of wildflowers that i've forgotten. :)"
"The need to know and the ability to predict what others are thinking to do or will do or how nature behaves is essential part of human scientific spiritual growth from the time we discovered Fire. For example we want to know whether rains come or not next year. This helps farmers to decide to either sow or not to sow. The rain pattern helps governments to prepare for draught management. Oppositions parties to blame governments. Again if rains come we want to know will there be heavy rains so that flood management can be activated. We want to know if there will be medium rains and limited water availability then planning can be done for alternate crop patterns. We also want to know if there will be very little rains so draught crops can be sown and water conservation can be activated. If there are super heavy rains like cyclones we want to know at least 2 days before so that all population can be evacuated to safe areas. The entire meteorology departments were existing for this function of predicting cyclones using again mathematical modeling of temperatures, wind gusts moisture etc."
"You see ever since we came to the UK just after our marriage, a little less than three years ago, we have been planning to travel. It was one of the juiciest carrots my husband dangled to bring me to the UK. He showed me dreams of seeing Europe, not in 15 days but slowly, steadily, a little at a time. Needless to say I fell for it, hook, line and sinker. The first year when he was a full time student and me, sporadically employed, travel was an unthinkable luxury. Second year we were finding our feet, settling in the hectic life of London fresh from the green pastures and slow life of Oxford. But by third year we were ready to travel.

There is just something so spiritual about being in the midst of nature. It seems easier to tap into that when you're right in the middle of it. I sometimes have to remind myself that all that wonder exists when I am stuck inside scrubbing a floor or doing the dishes. Yet, I know that I can find the spiritual side in those simple things too. It's just that I have to remind myself to do so a bit more."

"Like when I asked God for the miracle of weight loss and he gave that to me. I was told by many that I lost weight because of my work and willpower not because of God. They deny the power of God and give me the credit for something I was not capable of doing. The second I got arrogant and gave myself the credit I gained 100 pounds back. I did not have the ability to lose the weight, nor did I know what I was doing when I sowed the grass seed. I lost the weight and got the grass plus tree blooms because God blessed me with what I asked for. I asked God for signs to show me if what I read a few weeks ago was the truth. I got the signs. It was not just a random weather phenomena like many will claim. I got the signs and that is the power of God.

"Becky’s Mind: Bombarding – this word makes me think of doing the dishes. Every time I wash one plate, three more appear in the sink. It never ends and I feel like I’ll never leave the sink. That’s when I start making silly agreements in my mind. I agree that my family doesn’t deserve me. They don’t respect and understand me. They take advantage of me. They don’t really love me so I agree to not really love them back. Suddenly, I’m on one side of the wall and they’re on the other. That’s how Satan works in my life – just a few dirty plates at a time. He doesn’t come in and ransack the kitchen, no, that would be too obvious. He lets me get the last dish put away, then he brings me two more. I get those put away, and he shows up with three others. I handle those three, and he comes at me with one more. Satan slips one or two doubts at a time in there until before I know it, I’m putting up walls to keep God out as I make agreements with the enemy: God doesn’t respect me, He doesn’t deserve me. Wow. Who am I, the Point of Grace song goes, that He would love me gently, that He would recognize my name? I am His and He wants to help me tear down those walls so that He can walk with me! “…Walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.” Galatians 5:16-17."

"Jane believed she could find and refine those virtues in Mr. Rochester. I believed the same thing about my husband. Doesn’t that break the old rule, though? “Don’t choose a man thinking you’re going to change him?” Maybe a bit. But it comes down to what the man actually wants. Mr. Rochester wanted to be a good man. My husband wanted to be a good man. And the Rake always gets what he wants."
"Selfish glee: observing so many pages I had never seen. Evidence: pages I made for someone else. The Stories: priceless bonus (and favorite part of the book that never would have happened). To witness journal love by the many readers? An awesome added benefit. Being part of something that encourages artistic growth, including my own? That rocks."

"However, I’ve noticed that Paganism generally seems to have become a very insular spirituality. While folk do seek others of like mind to meet up and chat, in pubs or at Camps, generally their practise is kept private, at home or in quiet places outside, alone. This may be due to fear of ridicule, actual need for secrecy because of misunderstanding, or just a preference for a solitary mode of worship; I’ve no problem with that at all. Ultimately, any conversation that you have with deity is just the two of you."
Patience truly is a virtue. (Especially when there are only two service elevators for a building with 48 floors.)
"Then there is the fact that I left a job I loved, working for a wonderful Montessori school, to start my own in home preschool. I've been given the impression that some people in my community (who sniff out drama) think there is MORE to this story than there really is. That, since I'm being completely open here, is fricking exhausting! Look: People resign from their places of employment and start somewhere new every day. There is no big dramatic story to tell.

"During the meal, we chatted and at one point I asked Mark how he could be a Christian and yet much of his tour schedule consisted of playing at rowdy bars. Mark made reference to the Gospel passages that tell how Jesus went to be among the publicans and the sinners. He said that he wanted to minister to the people that really needed it and not so much to play in churches. His mission was to save lost souls. He knew that he still had a large fan base from the Grand Funk days and many of those fans frequented bars. If he was there with them, he might have the opportunity to minister to them. This sounded like a good answer to me."

"Our focus verse for the Say It With Scripture Challenge at the Sweet 'n Sassy Connection is 2 Corinthians 5:17, ""Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new."" Last week we talked about how our music should change once we've accepted Christ as Saviour. This verse tells us that the changes should not stop with just our music. Old things are to pass away and ALL things are become new. This means those old attitudes, actions, vocabulary and ways of thinking need to change. Depending on the person, it may require a change of wardrobe, viewing habits and how we interact with others. WHY do we need to change? Because we are a NEW creature in Christ. We are not the same as we used to be and we now wear the name of Christ. People should be able to see a difference in our lives; we should not look, act, sound or react like an unbeliever. This week, let's each take a look an inward look and ask the Lord to show us areas where we're allowing the world to creep back into our lives. Then, let's ask the Lord to help us make the changes necessary to make sure ""old things are passed away."""

"Having said that, I won’t rule out that sitting stationary at our family dining table in the front room and staring at my laptop for many hours of the day has something to do with feeling sluggish and tired. Admittedly it has often been the lack of any vibrant movement that has got me a bit irritated at times. But alas, when one needs their laptop for almost EVERYthing (as most people do nowadays): sending emails; monitoring projects; reading articles & journal entries; typing up documents etc…not to mention the fact that I haven’t seen or socialised with any of my friends for 8 days now (which is actually a long time when you usually live with your best friends), it’s pretty much a given that one would feel a tendency to get frustrated. However, this holiday, and other recent ones like it, I’ve been taking conscious steps to still remain a normal functioning human being, and not a robot from being cooped up in exile; studying, reading and writing."

"This drama is hilarious. I really had a great time watching it RAW and never did it waver when I finally watched it with subs. Lee Seung Gi is such a.. what’s the right term? Vainglorious? He’s played an arrogant-jerk in Shining Inheritance as a Chaebol. Then as an irresponsible, action-star-wannabe in MGIAG. Now, I feel like its a combination of all the characters he’s played and it fits him to a T. The teasers for this show kinda threw me off.. because I never thought of seeing Seung Gi to be so serious. I mean, military? Then again, drama surprised me since they didn’t really strip off Seung Gi of what I’ve known him to be and what I’ve grown to love about him."
"‘Like Crazy’ is a quiet movie. What you hear is low-key dialogue, as opposed to loud explosions and cars crashing. Unfortunately, the quiet tone of the film was interrupted by the loud eating of the couple to my left. These people were eating their pop corn with remarkable vengeance. It was as if the pop corn had inflicted major pain upon them and it was revenge-time. They were attacking the paper bag like it was the last available food on earth. And do you know what happens when you attack a paper bag? It makes a loud noise. And do you know what happens when you are munching pop corn? Yes, that’s right, you are very loud and the person to your right is wishing you would choke on it."
"Lip Service: And it's back. Like Sherlock, BBC3 decided that waiting nearly a year and a half for the second series of the Scottish drama was a great idea. On the plus side, this was a solid opening episode. I'm not keen on the Frankie/Cat/Sam triangle and I still don't like Jay as a character but overall, the episode was good. Tess's love life with the football fan Finn and her new co-stars (including bitchy Nora) are amusing and Lexy seems like she's going to be a good addition to the series, so welcome back ladies."
"2)SLAPPING CLARK GABLE. perhaps not good. I don't know. A compulsion. Can one exhume the girl? Completely? I wonder if I will write the girl continually, like hag-Duras in The Lover, and conjure her up, and conjure me up, will I ever feel at rest or at peace. Or perhaps: I will always be a girl, which is to be always in flux, the reclaiming of D&G's becoming-woman that uses all masculine archetypes. This was the subject, partially, of the Facebook discourse earlier today. Anyway: on: feminism and sex. On messy feminisms. On girlhood, which is being messy, and desire, which is always messy. The first piece for n+1 (if I can manage) due Labor Day - memoir+criticism+reportage? - on: Lena Dunham's Girls, and maybe Francesca Woodman, and maybe M.C., and maybe a subject of boundaries. But I think lately watching Girls using a good pal's HBO Go subscription, that I'm interested/obsessed with ideas of authenticity and this experience, and is that the search, authenticity. Versus what - a melodrama? Isn't being a girl melodramatic? Or: the other side of fakery: commodification. Am I making sense here? Also, as Kate Durbin said today on Facebook, horror is the perfect genre to consider the girl. Yes:and perhaps my issue with GIRLS: the TV show: it is sitcom when it also reads so queasy horror. I don't know. The second essay of this for Frequencies, due early fall? on Acker and the archive at Duke, but really: about how Acker subverts and complicates the idea of the Kunstlerroman, which maybe also segues with Lena Dunham's Girls, and MAYBE I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME WRITE ANYTHING DISCREETLY OR DISCRETELY. I don't know. Also: writing of Lispector, maybe. Thinking today of Macabea as a queasy, grotesque, girl in the woods. Mostly film + TV I think. The psychosis of ABC Family, Last Tango in Paris, Deneuve in Repulsion, idk. Tumblr. Gone with the Wind, obviously."

I wasn’t really expecting to learn as much an insight and moral from an action-packed movie – especially a superhero movie – such as The Avengers. Maybe I wasn’t into critiquing the plot of a movie or maybe I was boxed with the idea that movies do not necessarily reflect reality. But I sure did pick up lessons after I’ve seen the film.

"I read somewhere an argument that speaks to me on this: film studios have no real problem with ‘test screening’ a movie for audiences across the nation. The director of the movie doesn’t just drop some film reels off on some producer’s desk and walk away. There’s constant tweaking, even after it’s been called “done”. What are “director’s cut” editions, if not either the movie as the director originally envisioned it or tweaks to the film after it was shown to audiences? Book authors are a different matter, but they still have editors looking out to make sure the book is as cohesive as they can make it. Heck, even published works can get a brand-spanking new epilogue after the book’s been out for a while. So why is it that this video game, which has much more flexibility in terms of last-minute tweaks, is suddenly supposed to be set in stone? Nobody calls the test audience for movies “whiny entitled brats” if they didn’t like the ending. It means somebody misjudged the audience, and if it’s a serious enough misjudgement (is that even a word?) then the studios fix it. So even these other “works of art” are fixable right up to and beyond the point of publication/screening/distribution."

They were so kind and helpful and willing to answer questions...the residents and attending that I was with completely and totally made my month on psych a fantastic experience, and I could not be more thankful for that. I had one other student with me full time during the rotation and that only served to make the experience even better.

"For the second card I took another nestie label and this time fixed it with a little masking tape on the inside of the card and dry embossed with a ball tool on both the cutting edge and the inner embossing edge. If you've not tried this before, it's a nice easy technique - easier with a lightbox (but I didn't have time to dig mine out so it is possible without one). Secure the die inside with the cutting edge facing the outside of the card, turn it over and rub gently with a bone folder - this creates a soft line on top of the cutting edge so you know where to put your ball tool to begin. The trick is to go over the lines a couple of times to get the depth (I use a double ended tool and start with a thicker end then use a narrow one for definition once the fibres have stretched) - if you go too hard and deep too fast, you just rip the card stock. You can do the same thing on an embossing machine but I think you get a deeper impression by hand."

"Many of my favourite actors to work with have been my fellow theatre cast mates from theatre productions I’ve done over the years. But in film and TV, I have been fortunate, too, and some of my favs are Hilary Swank – she’s incredibly focused. Our scenes were so intense. I learned so much from working with her on ‘The Reaping’. I loved working with Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard on the FX TV series ’The Riches’. They are both such lovely spirited people, and were so devoted to that project. But my favourite star so far would have to be Brooke Shields, with whom I just finished working on ‘The Hot Flashes’. She is so sweet and down-to-earth, and really such a talented actor. She’s at the top of my Fav List right now, for sure."

She had told him about a sibling group of six children, ages 8 months to 13 years. He then told me that really she had only asked if we were available for four of those children, as they had found someone who would take the oldest and youngest already. They were Hispanic, and were currently split up in three different homes. Wow. That was a lot to take in. We spent an hour in prayer and talking about it before calling our worker back. The interesting thing was that my hubby’s devotions that day just happened to be the story of Moses, and how he was rescued from certain doom by someone not his mother; what amazing things did God do with him?!? What if God wanted to use us just as He used Pharaoh’s daughter, to step in and parent some children that He wanted to do great things with? We called our worker and asked her if we could just come by her office and meet with her."

It didn’t matter what sort of comment she wrote in the margin; it could have been a punctuation change. Whatever it was made me see red. Stubbornly, instead of learning from what she, the experienced professional, was flagging in my work, I dug in my heels and snottily thrust my nose in the air.

They were gonna be late. I helped the guys get ready and out the door, then cooked dinner for the remaining Harty's at home :)"

Who is looking out for the older sibling’s welfare? Who is going to nurture and love them? Make sure they are educated? Potty train them? Get them dressed and off to school? Do they even go to school?
"I guess the main thing that’s been bothering me all day is the war, the Middle East. It’s such a complicated subject. We’re supposed to be out of there, but there are still so many contractors getting away with having people in there and continuing to commit atrocities. When is it ever going to stop? Why do people join the army? Would there be such high entrance into the army if higher education was free?"
"“Oh, Him.” He was deliberating which chip to impale upon his fork; now really wasn’t the time for isagogics or theosophy. It was hard enough simply spelling them, let alone doing them, not that there was anything simple about spelling them. “Well, let’s see: his full name is Ubiquitous Eternity God, he’s a sixty-two year old unemployed song-writer living in California in a single room in The Brazil Hotel (it sounds grander than it really is), he’s got a fondness for Budweisers, massage parlours and walking out in front of oncoming traffic and stopping it with a wave of his hand while he crosses the road.”"
"I would further ask this sheikh: What are Muslims supposed to do when they see their rulers become servants for Israel and tools for their own enemies as well as thieves plundering billions of dollars from their people's coffers? Are they supposed to just sit down on their comfortable sofas and watch tyrants violate people's dignity, usurp people's rights and ruin the people's wealth, pending the arrival of the Day of Reckoning?"
"It was shortly after their ten year anniversary that Michael saw his opportunity. His wife brought him a screwdriver, asking if he'd hang a picture in their bedroom. He took the tool and examined it closely. It was when his wife asked why he was looking at it that his mind crossed that barrier that separates what we want to do and what we do, and he killed her with the screw driver, and then proceeded to hang the picture that she'd asked him to."
"But assume I didn’t live in the forest any more, but in China. Some kind of fortune or misfortune has brought me there. Let’s assume that. Now that would be terribly unpleasant. For in China, as is well known, everyone is Chinese, even the emperor. I would stand out. My name is Hase, and I look like a German. One would be able to recognize me immediately. Why, even the children would stand stock still in the street and call out “That’s Hase.”"

"I met Jacob, another American and the only other person staying at the hotel the afternoon I arrived. We hung out the next few days. It was great to have someone to see the sites with. The churches are split into two groups, North and South. It costs about $25 to see them, and if you want a guide, it's another $20! Such high prices in such a poor country, with very few people seeing that money. I went with Jacob and his guide to see the Southern churches- which was nice, because when I walked around the Northern churches alone, I had no idea which church I was looking at."

"What's the purpose behind S&S's new policy? I'm guessing that S&S is gambling that electronic rights will become hugely valuable at some point in the future. Right now they aren't, and I don't believe that anyone, even the most vigorous prognosticators, knows how or in what ways they may become so. But with its rights grab, S&S is hedging its bets, retaining control of books it may be able to exploit in new ways as times change and new technology becomes available. In this situation, authors are double losers--first, because they lose control of their rights forever, and second, because if S&S does exploit the rights at some future point, it will be doing so under old contracts. As the development of the ebook market has made clear, new technologies demand new terms and new negotiations."

"As for Jerome, he did mention reasons for skepticism of 2 Peter, and he only lists stylistic reasons which he explained as being due to Peter’s usage of different scribes.[56] History knows of 3 scribes for Peter: Silvanus (1 Peter 5:12), Mark (recorded by Eusebius)[57] and Glaucias (recorded by Clement).[58] It is more than likely that Jerome’s understanding of literary difference due to different scribes is reasonable. It’s perfectly reasonable to suggest that 2 Peter records the writing style and vocabulary of Glaucias (or some unknown scribe)."
"Kipling’s Just So Stories: I used to be put to bed at 8:00 every night, without fail – regardless of the time of year. This annoyed me – especially in the summertime.

I remember one of the first books I enjoyed during this time was Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories. I was around 7 or 8."

Now I have them collected with some of my favorite colors and background techniques and all artful. And I can carry them with me! As I used a ring that I can open and close, I can also add to the ring when I’m working on a new affirmation or mantra…and I have extra circles cut so that when I want to play but don’t have anything particular artsy in mind, I can make more affirmation cards.

That’s racist towards white people, and not just society as a whole. Because everyone is racist on some level, why should whites be targeted any more than Asians or Africans? Being of a certain ethnic background doesn’t make you racist. It’s a human condition. The blog link doesn’t reflect that, so no, I’m not going to check it out."

"For a second opinion, I sent it to a close friend (who knows me all to well) to read, and give feedback. She loved it (Fear obliterated) but thought there might be some questionable parts (Fear confirmed)…for a moment I thought maybe it was a bad idea, putting myself out there exactly how I am, I was getting ready for a rewrite…when a text arrived from my friend. She said that she had reread it and thought that I shouldn’t change anything! There wasn’t anything questionable, she reevaluated, and she thought it was fabulous!

"Build smaller prisons. ... Large prisons become ""violentocracies"" -- places ruled by violence and by the threat of violence. In a violentocracy, the most violent people rise to the top. In any prison of any size, the prisoners are going to be pushed toward the level of the most violent persons in the facility. ... In a prison 3,000 people, the entire prison is pushed toward the level of violence created by the five most violent people in the joint. The most violent person finds the second-most violent person and the third-most violent person, and they form an alliance to exploit the weak. Everyone else is compelled to avoid looking weak. ... Large prisons promote paranoia in the prisoners. You never know who in here is waiting for you with a homemade knife. ... A prison of 20 people is, by its very nature, extremely different. You know who is in there with you; you know who you have to stay away from. ... Plus, if you have many small prisons, you can contain the violent people in a limited number of those prisons, the preventing their violent tendencies from infecting the rest of the prison population. ... What you would do, with a network of small prisons, would be to place each prisoner in a facility that is appropriate to the threat that he represents. You grade the prisoners on the threat of violence that they represent, one through ten. You put the tens with the tens and the ones with the ones. Plus, when you move to a system in which some prisoners have more rights and live in more humane conditions, you create a powerful incentive to get into one of the less restrictive prisons.. In a large and horrible prison, the new prisoner thinks ""I've got to show everybody here how tough and vicious I really am, so that nobody will mess with me."" But when you put a new prisoner in a 24-man prison with 23 other tought guys, and he knows that there are other prisons that are not like this, his natural thought is ""I've got to get out of here. I've got to show these people that I am not a crazy, vicious sociopath, so they will move me to some other facility that is not populated by crazy, vicious sociopaths."""

"It is much more difficult to see a propaganda system at work where the media are private and formal censorship is absent. This is especially true where the media actively compete, periodically attack and expose corporate and governmental malfeasance, and aggressively portray themselves as spokesmen for free speech and the general community interest. What is not evident (and remains undiscussed in the media) is the limited nature of such critiques, as well as the huge inequality in command of resources, and its effect both on access to a private media system and on its behavior and performance."

"In this heavily-anticipated sequel to 2012 Enigma, (#1 Most Viewed on Google, 12/1/08), David Wilcock presents a compelling case that the prophecies of a Golden Age are not myth or superstition. Our DNA has been evolving 100 times more rapidly in the last 5000 years due to a natural galactic process which is also creating climate change throughout our entire solar system. If the prophecies are correct, psychic abilities and powers such as telekinesis, levitation, spiritual healing and telepathy may soon become as common as breathing."

"It is always a truly peculiar situation. The tension residing in the interstices between the one and the other. The stark juxtaposition between percept and affect. The grinding in between. The antagonism we reference above is resultant of one being thrown amongst the detritus of society. Those forgotten. That’s how it begins. A violence that confronts the somnambulist as they are awakened from their complacent, passive, acceptance of the world about. The attempt to striate the miasma, to diffuse the smell, to relegate and delineate roles and responsibility, has created a zone of possibility where finally . . . finally, the representative becomes expressive. This I believe was the goal and intent of a Ms. Zoe Strauss. An utterance that could finally be discerned from the constructed milieu of an art world, of a home, of a people. One that resounded “don’t forget us”."

"I found it very interesting that they put information about the legends of dragons in China. Supposedly the dragon stands as a symbol for the great unity of the Chinese nation. It says some Chinese considered themselves as descendants of a dragon. The dragon was the symbol of the emperor, yet people used to worship the dragon because they believed it would bring the timely winds and rains for their crops. The dragon was seen as a symbol of harmony. Not a great deal of information, but certainly the little bit there was I found to be quite interesting. I like it when chart books come with little bits of information like this one did. The pattern book Ancient Egyptian Cross Stitch by Barbara Hammet had a lot of information about ancient Egypt to go along with the beautiful patterns that were in there."

"There are only two authors whose complete published works I’ve read: Samuel Beckett and Richard Brautigan. By ‘complete’ I mean of course those that are still generally available.

True happiness is impossible in this lifetime, we can only hope for a nicer afterlife.

"Last night, I caffeinated-up with the intention of cleaning for an hour, writing for an hour, then going to bed. Instead, I played on Facebook and a homeschool message board and wasn't a bit tired when Kyle headed to bed. The kids were in bed. The kitchen was quiet. No one was using the CD player. I had an audio book beckoning me. The time to clean out the craft supplies had come."

"And, lo and behold, Santa stopped by Tesoros one day at lunch and found the motherlode.

"This past weekend was my first Saturday in many weeks that I did not have to get up early for class. Although it was great to be able to sleep in and enjoy the feeling of being lazy on a Saturday morning, I felt as though I was missing something. Yes, I miss the fun and my new friends of my public speaking class."
In month 5 you buy another cloth diaper ($20) and decide to only get 1/2 case of disposables ($20) since you see a light at the end of the tunnel and don't think you'll need them for much longer. You are now down to using only 3 disposables a day.

"So, off to Jozi tomorrow and what with there only being 24hrs in the day and me being approximately 729 hours behind the Jozi Gym Schedule, I’m clearly going to be pushed for packing time tonight. Whilst I hear Jozi is doing its best Cape Town winter impression of just being generally shiyt in all aspects, I am also not surprised to hear that it’s fallen short of the Southern mark once more. Check out the SupeRugby log, boet."
"This is the third cake in a row last week, out of four (not counting the mini cakes). I almost officially feel like I want to take a break from baking for a week, but of course that'll never happen.

They moved the tent. My brother handed the ashes to the worker who stood in the hole. He placed the box inside a steel box in the ground. Then they asked if we had anything else to place in the box with her. We didn’t know we could do that. No one told us and I didn’t think to ask. I had never done this before. But nephew’s mom had the bouquet which she was pleased to put in the box. I put in a red rose as did my sister-in-law. That was it. We didn’t know what else to do.
"I want my thoughts to disappear but they won’t, and I won’t do anything to make them vanish. I remember when he said that “we both went into this relationship knowing it wouldn’t last forever.” That was at the beginning of it. In the middle, we did want it to last forever, but honestly, it never was going to last forever, and I never knew that I would have shared everything with him. I sincerely wish it could have been forever. I really wish it could have been longer, at least make happier memories. It’s really sad. I’m not ready to give back these things. I feel so, so light yet heavy. The necklace is off, and has been off and I miss it… I want it back on, but I won’t put it on."
"We have a lot of basil in our garden, somehow this year I've managed to grow more of it than I normally use (there seems to be forever a jar of pesto in the fridge!), which just means that I've become a bit more creative in how I use it, or (most of the time) just throw it into dishes more often. It added an extra dimension to a stir fry of thinly sliced kangaroo (marinated briefly in soy, sambal oelek and garlic), mushrooms, a red pepper from the garden and jasmine rice - its stronger aniseed notes went really well with the asian flavours in the wok. It was such a simple delicious dinner, I'm no longer bound by Italian cooking when thinking of how to use my basil! I have purple basil as well, but tend to use the green basil more often purely because I have more of it, it's thrived where the purple basil has been much more subdued (though its a very pretty addition to any garden!)."
It explained that it decided to take the action as a result of several incidents such as Ministers being barred from addressing Kgotla meetings.
"Most of the military build-up is concentrated against Abkhazia and South Ossetia. A modern, NATO-compatible barracks has just been built in Senaki in western Georgia not far from Abkhazia, and another one is under construction near Gori, a half-hour driving distance from Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia. According to the report, each of these bases will have the capacity to house a brigade, with a troop-strength of 3,000."
"Ahem. Back to the story: I was in second grade, and somehow my teacher convinced me to represent the class. I still remember the white dress my mom made me wear, with matching white tights and shoes (what was with the all-white ensemble?? *scratches head*). My dad coached and helped me practice at home. The song was...The Alphabet Song. It goes something like this:"

"Teachers have a different ‘knowledge’ than parental knowledge and it comes into play because unlike any other profession, teachers are given the PRIVILEGE of working with children and often times the parents don’t even know us by name. Teachers have to earn that trust day in and day out – with parents, but more importantly with students. The trust is so explicit that we are often told more than anyone else by students about their life and only when we have proof or a darn strong feeling that the ‘hypothetical’ discussion taking place is real can we report the issue to parents or social services. We can ask all manner of questions, suggest other people the student can talk to, services and phone numbers to contact but we are limited in giving opinions. By law we are mandated reporters and we stress to children that what they tell us falls into this category because we want them to know we care enough to do what is right, no matter what the outcome. Sometimes the most we can do is recommended to the school psychologist, the administrator, etc. that this child have an appointment. We can not even write our concerns in the cumulative file so we share them with another teacher(s) because each child is so precious to us and we don’t want something to happen."
"At the Vatican, Borgia’s called aside by della Rovere, who tells Borgia that, if he were a different man, della Rovere would vote for him. Borgia’s been a good vice chancellor, and the skills that made him good at that would serve the papacy well, but Borgia’s also lacking in honesty and other qualities della Rovere thinks are necessary in a pope, so he plans to fight Borgia to the end. Borgia calmly says he tends to win any battles he fights, but after all, this is in God’s hands."

"As this was of course, a rather special card, I decided to make it a coordinating box, so used the same pearlescent cardstock as the card base & part of the cross for the box's top & decorated it with another Spellbinders' cross as well as a lacy shape from the Lace Doily Accents set. The four tiny sections which had popped out of the die cut silver cross I used as embellishments & added them to the corners of the box lid. I then created an insert for the box (well, it isn't as if I didn't have enough to do is it, LOL), and this time used a sentiment from 'verses-for-cards'."

"Also, how do you have more money in your pocket? Work. You slug your way out, climb up the corporate ladder, do plenty of OTs, just to earn a few more bucks. By the time you get home, you’ll be too tired to have a proper bonding session with your children. Having kids and seeing them only a few hours each day and two full days is not going to help bond the kid with the parents."
"I also learned that I need to follow my very first instinct when it comes to picking music to listen to. If I get an inkling I might like to hear some particular song, I need to switch to that song AT THAT MOMENT, with a playlist by similar artists. It doesn't really matter whether they suit the mood of the writing, though up-tempo music is better than miserable stuff (of which I have a lot). The important thing is to be comfortable with my audio environment."

The evidence she relied on (which included a poem of mine which had been doctored to make it appear anti-Jewish) was not, he concluded, a fair portrayal of my views. In reality, I reject any and every form of racism, including antisemitism."

No need to color code my laying flock anymore, like we used to, so sticking with this breed in fine with me. I also can’t say enough about buying from a hatchery that has been in business for a long time. We used to get our chicks from a hatchery in Washington and when high feed prices drove them to retirement, we switched to this hatchery on the recommendation of a friend. The chicks are always in good shape when they arrive and do well here."

"Thanks for the Great blog. Something about myself. I have recently immigrated to a country were I had no job lined up or were I could not even speak the Language. To say that my first year was the most difficult time of my life would be a major understatement. I have now seemed to have crossed the largest hurdle, found a job and settled in. This is the sacrifice I had to make for my families freedom and survival. It saddens me however to read and hear about my beloved countries further decline into anarchy. I am therefore at a complete loss of words when the loved ones that remained behind have optimism for the future. What is this based on? Surely they are privy to the same information and news that I see and hear."

"'When your Daemon is in charge, do not try to think consciously. Drift, wait, and obey...' I knew this for the simple truth too. I concluded, from experience, that the Daemon always knows the detail and construction of a piece It has decided you will work on, but It cannot tell you directly. Or chooses not to tell. You are guided by images and feelings, steered along the path it wants you to follow by nudges and hints. When we are 'stuck' in a story, we have simply wandered from the path. If we stop trying to find it, if we try not to think consciously, but wait and let our thoughts drift – then the Daemon will guide us back to the path with more hints and nudges. When we struggle to find the way ourselves, we fall into mires and thorns, we get further and further from where we want to be, and the story 'goes dead under our hand'."

"Here, Kali refers to the personified kali-yuga. Pretention and fakery is his primary character trait. The cow-couple refers to the cow of Mother Earth and the bull of dharma.

The only leg that remains in Kali Yuga is truthfulness. The age itself pummels away at this leg so that it crumbles and is completely destroyed as the age progresses."

With 25 years of crafting under my belt, I've collected a lot of stuff (all good I tell ya, I might need it or I might go back to it).

"In the opening chapter, The Deity of Christ Today, Stephen J. Nichols bounces off the work of Stephen Prothero and argues that we have gone from a creedal Jesus, to a human Jesus that is close and ended up with a Jesus that has liberated itself from Christianity and the Bible (p. 27). Stephen points out that there have been many attempts within our American culture to present Jesus. Movies like The Passion of Christ, consumerism and our nifty slogans and even politics where Jesus is somehow on everyone’s side, show us that our cultural attempts to display Jesus have left us with “personal Jesuses who look far more like their makers than like the Jesus of sacred Scripture and the historical creeds (p.31).”"

"I have to say, it wasn't all that bad. He offered up his seat at the bar, like a true gentleman and flagged the bar tender over to take my drink order. Paid for my beverage. When our table was ready, he took out my seat and ordered a fantastic bottle of wine to go with dinner. The conversation was relaxed and easy, and then I made a joke. The laugh that came from the person sitting in front of me made me want to run for the high hills! I was not only loud, but had this quality of being high pitched, nasal'y and throat'y all at the same time. I was literally the kind of laugh that makes you cringe from the inside-out. I nervously chuckled, looked around the room to see that people's heads had actually turned and realized that this extreme laugh would take this guy down a long road of lonely unhappiness."

"Having made this acknowledgement, the logical next step is to delete this section. One cannot make this cut on the basis of promises of pie in the sky. Virtually everyone in Irish society, including myself, would love to see a Scandinavian model of child care being in place by the end of this year. I differ from some of those who claim it would not be possible, in that I believe it would be possible were there a real will and determination to make it happen. However, significant resources would be required. This defies credibility, given the fact that this idea is coming from a Government that is slashing, burning and cutting left, right and centre and is committed to considerable further budget cuts in the next two years under the EU-IMF austerity programme. If we pass the fiscal treaty, we will be required to make even more severe budget cuts in subsequent years. From where will the Government get the money and resources to put in place a Scandinavian child care model? The Minister and I would like to see such a model. Ireland did not put it in place when the Celtic tiger was in full swing, yet the Minister is telling the House that she will have it in place within six months at a time when austerity butchery is cutting everything. The Minister does not honestly believe it will be done."

"In the hard single bed, Kathleen’s feet sweat as she heard Claire stomping down the stairs to deliver her some Indian dish that she picked up every Wednesday from a trendy grocery store on her way home from work. It was too spicy for Kathleen’s palate and the meat was the same indistinguishable goop as the vegetables, but she ate it every week and pretended to be appreciative. She took a few bites to appease Claire, who was tittering about what she had for lunch that day at work. Claire looked all around the room, focusing her eyes on the bed skirt, the crooked throw rug, the smashed bug high in the left corner that no one had the heart to wipe away. Kathleen could tell that Claire had things that she wanted to say but couldn’t bring herself to. Every few days she’d bring up the cancer in felted tones but Kathleen would always stop the conversation before it got too far, before it made her scared."
"The square broke into deafening applause. Dust rose in the air as kids stomped on the ground in jubilation. Women ululated. Nibras's wife emerged through the cloud of dust and joined her husband and Mr. Think in the epicenter of the celebration, a huge grin of relief on her face."
"So the run went pretty well. Only went 4 miles, but still not bad for someone who hasn't done much physical activity in a while. It was quite tiring but oh well I guess I'll deal with it. The sun was pretty hot at 8 am. Didn't really expect that. I would have went swimming afterwards if the rain didn't come in. Stupid rain... I used to love the rain now I hate it, man, what is up with me?"

"As one of our three substitutes I decided to take the opportunity to ask him about his role. Sadly, he wasn't keen on conversation, which on reflection is probably an occupational hazard, what with the headset. For all I know he could have been in on a conference call with a host of delegates from FIFA's head office in Zurich. This is unlikely though. I would expect an organisation as spendthrift as FIFA to be more generous with the quality of employee trousers. By all accounts Sepp Blatter is a tolerant man, but badly pressed black trousers would not reflect well on FIFA. No, a far more plausible explanation was that his headset was plugged into a cassette player. The assessor would spend his evening listening to the recording in order to write his report on the referee's performance. Let it be said, the role of referee's assessor isn't all glamour."

"The problem that is the longest running and has given us the biggest headache is the problem of the other neighbour's barking dog. We seem to have written endless letters and e-mails to the Environmental Health Department of the local council together with the completion of many time sheets detailing when, how often and for how long the dog has been barking. At present the problem is still unresolved. After I posted A night on the tiles I had intended to write a post explaining some more of the background to the problem, but I did not do so, because we had a surprise intervention into the problem, on our behalf. Consequently I felt that it was wiser to keep quiet. The intervention came to nothing and I shall write the intended post shortly."

Especially not if a career means that everything hinges on how much power you have and how much money you earn (read: being a slave to someone and to money, always)."

"Doesn't that tell you something then, Pell? If you are claiming that the smoking ban reduced preterm births because it made people give up smoking, the fact that you found the same result with nonsmokers rather gives the game away, does it not? If, on the other hand, you're suggesting that reducing secondhand smoke miraculously reduces preterm births (I haven't read the study yet, but I wouldn't put it past you to indulge in such superstition), the findings for smokers strongly suggest that this is nonsense as well. Or perhaps you are going to claim that smokers somehow feel the benefit of secondhand smoke reductions as well. Nothing would surprise me at this stage."
"Having earlier said that I can understand not going too deep into the backstory, a critical element of the books is classism, leaving it out of the movie altogether, or only *barely* mentioning it, does the series an extreme disservice, as that's THE ENTIRE THEME OF THE BOOKS. (okay, maybe not the entire theme, but a main one) When you ""get"" that children are putting their names into the drawing for tributes more than once in order to possibly win food/wealth for their families, it brings that class/poverty/social-strati thing right to the forefront. The kids from well-off families aren't in there but once. Yes, it's mentioned in passing, but it's not explained."

"And now, the extremely funny news. Even those of us who do become indistinguishable from native speakers, including where native speakers themselves can’t tell the difference, fail to reach native proficiency: we have near-native-like proficiency instead (I’m not joking, seriously!). This is because we human beings, for all our native competence, are apparently fallible in our judgements about our languages. We don’t notice what we don’t care about, whereas the machines that we build to make our judgements for us do: the proof is in reported examples of millisecond differences in, for example, the amount of puffed air that emanates from native and non-native vocal tracts pronouncing the sounds at the beginning of English words like pan, tan and can (this is the “aspiration of voiceless plosives”, in the insider lingo)."

Mr Sevje also claimed that peace can only be achieved if the Israelis engage in direct talks with the terrorist organization Hamas:"

"But first, let me take you back to the summer of '91 when I was an LCA on the 727 panel at Pan Am. Things were not going well. We were selling routes. The BIG cherry just picked was the European operation (Frankfurt hub/A-310s) and the NY shuttle (LGA hub/727s) going to Delta. Delta wanted the crews they were prepared to take already trained in seat and type. So to accomodate the senior folk ALPA, the FEIA and management REBID the airline. Those who would have been saved from the inevitable collapse (like me) by going to Delta were now looking down both barrels at unemployment, furlough notice in hand and 90 days to figure out what to do. Yeah, my union was looking out for me again god bless 'em. So when I get called into the office and told in effect ""You will be training your replacements"" (the 747 F/Es who were bidding back to the 727 panel) I was at a loss for words. A thousand emotions flew across my mind."

"Yesterday was different. We visited the Morgan car factory - a 2-hour tour that anyone can take, but this was organised by TCAS as part of the 'Escape to the Hills' weekend. What always fascinates me when on such an outing is looking behind the scenes, the organisation, the attention to detail in so many aspects of a company. This post will not be a 'write-up' of Morgan - a British-owned, family-run firm since 1905, every beautiful car put together by hand, skilled workforce using hand-tools - just a gallery of the snapshots I was able to take as we walked from one dedicated workshop to another. I won't even caption the photos, for I cannot pretend to understand the technical aspects; hopefully such shots as I was able to take will speak for themselves. Words fail me for once - though I could research it if I needed to; most of the time I couldn't hear the tour guide anyway, for I lagged behind aiming for photos that showed the workmanship and not the backs of strangers!"

"Parenting, for me, has been like productivity boot camp and I’ve had to get pretty creative when my husband’s working late, the pasta’s boiling over, my daughter just cut her finger, my son is about dump paint on the floor, the phone rings, and the dog is begging to go out. Yes, parenthood can take over at times and prevent you from doing anything else. I find, though, that when I have time, I’m very aware of what I really want to spend my precious time on, which somehow allows me to access that creative energy faster. But hey, it’s just a theory. Maybe it’s just all that coffee I’ve been drinking."

"Of course every day here looks like a sunny day you’d find front and center in a postcard and the film is super full of the values that are adored by the conservative demographic that makes up a nice portion of Mr. Sparks’ target audience, while still providing the sexy scenes with the sexy actors to draw in the other demos. But it kind of works as that romance in Louisiana story; it’s just hurt quite a lot by the fact that the secret that Logan’s keeping just looms over the whole movie even if it’s not mentioned, especially because it’s not that big a deal when you dissect it had he just told it when he arrived there. But it’s when the film tries to go all heavy-handed dramatic with Beth’s ex that it’s just too bad to bear."

Coffee, tea and meat are just three of the dietary changes that people make as they begin to vibrate faster. Meat is especially dense and can really affect the body’s energy, especially if it has hormones in it. You may develop cravings for certain foods, or go off your favorite foods. This is normal and a part of the change to the higher vibration. If you find this happening, then let it happen and explore the new possibilities."
"Swigging a bit of Coors Light last night after seeing a six pack in the supermarket for £2. Not a national offer, I think they were shifting old stock. Which got me thinking that whenever I have necked this grog it’s usually an offer on old stock. Its never promoted in big cheap boxes. At least it was within its sell by date, though. I used to neck this grog regularly, but that stuff was all past its sell by date. So it was interesting to compare the bouquet and flavour of the beer pre and post date. Not a lot to compare really. It’s flavourless watery grog that slips down nicely. Light of flavour and light on calories according to the bottle. The lady squeeze likes this one and joined me for a bottle. She even managed a belch."

"Here's how this image came to be associated with a Boy Scout troop in Milwaukee (what a long strange trip it's been...) One of the kids belonging to Troop 11 took a vacation trip to south Texas and while there noticed and photographed a road sign with this image on it. He and several of his fellow Troop 11 Scouts decided this would make a great patch for their 'patrol'. (Here's a quickie Boy Scout primer for you: a troop is made up of 20-60 boys, and each troop is divided into individual 'patrols' of 5-9 kids. The kids in each 'patrol' name their own group and create a patch to signify themselves.)"

So I popped to Wilkinsons to get a fork and picked up a pack of PLASTIC forks, knives and spoons. I went to pay at the till and was told by the cashier that I had to be OVER 21 to buy these PLASTIC knives. I had to swap the packet for one that contained only forks despite the fact that plastic forks are actually much sharper than plastic knives!!"

The garlic is still fine to eat, and as that same farmer pointed out, we're not using mechanical planting machines and other industrial means to plant it, so our problems are compounded less.

"The last time I saw Taylor for the next 20 hours or so. A little blurry, but the last time I laid my eyes upon him this day. He wanted to walk ahead and I decided to get out my video camera and record some of the river scene, and see if I could go back and get the whio on film. There is a very distinct waterfall on the true left of the river not so far from where Taylor is above. From there it is less than 30 minutes to the hut, and a large orange marker indicates a track that cuts through the forks to the hut on the true right just before the forks. Taylor walked right by it."
"In 1969 Bukowski accepted an offer from Black Sparrow Press publisher John Martin and quit his day job (delivering mail for the USPS) to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, ‘I have one of two choices — stay in the post office and go crazy … or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.’ Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, ‘Post Office.’"
That actually explains a lot. It is wonderful to know that she feels safe and comfortable with me. Really! I just wish she would find another way to show me her trust.
"Shrove Tuesday is the day before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of Lent, for Catholics. Lent is the 40 days preceding Easter, which Catholics usually restrict guilty pleasures and try to eat simpler and leaner. So, since pancakes are made with sugar, fat, flour, eggs, which is traditionally restricted during lent; they have become to popular way to start off Lent. Since Lent is about giving up indulgences, I figured I'd give you all a pancake that would be worthy of Pancake Tuesday."
"As you can imagine, this turn of events left the U.S. in quite a pickle: In 1804, Americans were not yet willing to extend the revolutionary ideals of equality they had just established for themselves to their black slaves, and quite frankly, Haiti's ability to do so scared the pants off of them. It wasn't really a high point in American diplomatic history, and so the Haitian Revolution maybe has gotten dusted under the rug a bit in the history books. So this new exhibit is a welcome reprieve from that omission, putting the events in Haiti in their rightful place in the global narrative of that revolutionary period."

It was a wonderful experience and the girls loved it. Grandma Paula and I wished they had picked Pretty Princess or Diva Princess like Willow's Pretty Hair Piece but Piper and Harley both picked Rainbow Hair Pop Princess.

"Unwrap one pie crust and spread it out in the bottom of baking dish. Bake in 350 degree oven until it's golden brown. While the pie crust is baking, I peel and chop up vegetables. Put chicken stock in stock pot and heat up over medium-high heat. Once the stock is boiling, add vegetables to the pot and cook until they are tender. Mix 2 tablespoons of corn starch with 3 tablespoons of water in a separate bowl. Add the corn starch mixture to the chicken broth and cook over medium heat until the broth has thickened (about 5 minutes). Add one container of chicken to the stock pot. Let cook a few minutes then pour mixture into the crust and top with the other pie crust. Bake in 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown."

"The heat of the summer is more of an issue here, than winter cold. In the enclosed part, there are doors that open to screened windows to get cross ventilation. In July and August I keep an old sheet draped over the top to shield the coop from the brutal afternoon sun, since our back yard neighbor cut down their large oak tree. Sometimes I wet the sheet down to help them keep cool, when we hit triple digits. Ameracaunas are a good hot weather breed, as they are not very big and heavy. There are usually only a few nights in the winter when we have to rig up a heat lamp. This winter I think we only used it a total of 4 nights."

"I was out all day Saturday, with some of my plans for the day coming through and some not. I spent the morning and early afternoon at a huge art festival in Brooklyn. From there, I had planned on going to a smaller art exhibit also in Brooklyn, but the trains made it difficult. It was partly my fault; I probably could've left DUMBO a half-hour earlier (that's Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass to you non-New Yorkers), but I was enjoying the day too much. Still, I had to take a completely roundabout trip to Greenpoint because the trains that would've gotten me there quicker weren't running normally. I knew when I got off the train that I wouldn't have had any time for this show, so I reluctantly chose to blow it off and head to Jersey City for the highlight of the day - a return to the Landmark Loews Jersey Theater."
"It's been an extraordinarily wet day. If this were a Thomas Hardy novel I'd be fighting for my life by now, with some unspecified fever. As it is, I just have slightly muddy trousers.

"“Embedding a customer service mindset” goes beyond outward appearances, masked employees, and careful placement of sanitary facilities. The mindset depends of values – shared values of company and employee. No trading of ideas, complaints, concerns? No engagement.

"On Sunday, we were able to head south to Kokomo to visit Steph’s grandma and celebrate Thanksgiving with her. We had a good meal and a great time seeing her; it has been awhile since she’s been able to see Levi in person, but she’s been one of his strongest supporters since day one. We love you grandma, and it was so nice to spend the day with you. We are happy that it’s a short work week; later this week we will head down to celebrate Thanksgiving with Steph’s family, then down to my family after that. We are all looking forward to the Thanksgiving holiday. It has always been my favorite. In my mind, it seems to be the last pure holiday. I know the crazy shopping commences the day after, and some families seem to jump right over it to get to the craziness of Christmas quicker, but maybe that’s why I like it so much. The day is what it needs to be. It’s a day set aside to give thanks for who you are, who you’re with, what you have, and where you’re going. It’s about family, community, and reflection. Add in a great meal and spice it with a little football, and there you have it. The perfect holiday. And I thank God that I can spend it with my family complete."

My favorite tea shop--Mariage Frères--was an easy stroll from my studio. My favorite teeny, tiny Paris parks were quiet and welcoming every hour of the day, and whenever I needed a ""pretty fix,"" I could wander down the rue Vielle du Temple and stop in at Le Jardin Moghul for their quilted, hand-block-printed Rajasthani garments. That's where I got pieces like the quilted jacket covered with big poppies worn a few weeks ago."

That would be a hell of a party, I can assure you."
"Depending on the sort of story you're writing, this isn't necessarily a problem. In a dorky sci-fi story like this one, that obviously isn't taking itself too seriously, readers typically aren't going to take the scientific explanations too seriously, either. If your story is magical or implausible, your readers probably won't be looking for a reasonable explanation for things. J.K. Rowling didn't have to explain the physics that allow broomsticks to fly; Stephenie Meyer didn't need to go into detail about exactly how many of Edward's internal organs still functioned normally. This little tidbit is probably most important for historical fiction and science-based novels like those by Michael Crichton - the history and science need to be believeable."
"I took my couple of steps, which is all they wanted to start with anyways, then got back in bed feeling very ill. Told the nurses I wanted OFF that morphine pump! Okay, they would switch me to Demoral by mouth. It seemed okay at first, at least I wasn't feeling sick."

"It used to be that when you went over they would slow your service down so much that you could maybe get your email to open, but that was it. If you called they would sometimes let it go and reset it and other times you just had to wait twenty four hours. Recently they came up with a new system where if you go over you could pay five bucks and bingo your speed has been restored or you can wait twenty four hours. Since they started two months ago we have somehow gone over our limit around ten times. A few days ago I spent an hour on the phone trying to get the tech support guy to tell me what the hell they had changed so that I could avoid this. He of course assured my that nothing had changed and as a sign of good faith reset my service without charge, but I know they messed with something. Somehow they changed the way they count the megabytes in order to get customers to pay a little more. Right now I have no options because they have a monoploy on the market.

He can electrocute as many people he wants to with battery cables, impale them on umbrellas, strangle them with car antennae, and shoot innocent bystander after innocent bystander - but he is not a threat: he's more like a ""Saturday Night Live"" character they introduce at about the 1:00 AM mark."

Performed by just one man in the cavernous space of the Lyttleton, this is the most sublimely affecting theatre I’ve seen in years. Cillian Murphy is an astonishing actor and the star of two of my favourite films of the last fifteen years: Disco Pigs and 28 Days Later.

Another favorite fairy tale of mine is THE LITTLE MERMAID. I know where this one comes from. 1) Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID was my favorite movie when it first came out.

I really do think that Disney and Ariel are partially to blame for this obsession.

"From education to the environment, those in the know would be able either to push a new administration towards their own fields of opportunity or anticipate the business that new ministers would create. Organisations such as the ANC's PBF, and possibly clones of Britain's Chemistry Club, will be in the pound seats, selling time with those who can sell access to wealth for the people excluded by the current elite."
"In 2007 after losing her husband, Mark, in a plane crash, she decided to change careers. At this time she was informed that the photographs she took in Africa for her Mother In-Law’s charity, Hands of Hope, helped to raise thousands of dollars for them. At this point she decided to pursue photography as a profession by enrolling in classes at Columbia College. The following years Sarah spent traveling around the world taking photographs for various Charities as Sarah Wauterlek Photography. She has exhibited her work downtown LA with RAW Artists and was chosen as a semi-finalist."
"My husband and I were anxiously awaiting our 20 week ultrasound – it was right before Christmas and we could not wait to go home and tell our family the sex of the baby. Right away I could tell that something was wrong. As I watched the tech measure my baby the measurements seemed so small: 17w2d head, 16w5d arm, 17w3d belly, etc. The tech then asked me why I was here so early for my 20 week ultrasound. I told her that I was 20 weeks today and that I was not early. She didn’t seem overly concerned and just reported that my dates had to be wrong. I knew that my dates were not wrong, I had had an ultrasound almost every week up until week 11 and the baby had measured correct the whole time. Once my ultrasound was finished we went to talk to the doctor. He was not able to give us any information other than our baby girl was measuring four weeks behind and that her umbilical cord was a two vessel cord instead of a three vessel cord. I was told to try and gain some weight (I had only gained about 3-4 pounds thus far) and to come back in three weeks to see if she had grown. It was hard to stay optimistic over Christmas. Friends and family were telling us that things were going to be just fine, that she was just going to be a small baby, but this mama knew differently. I knew that there was something seriously wrong and I knew that I was never going to be bringing my baby home."
"Waterproofs come next, and not word of a lie, my favourite cost me six euros from a Decathlon store in France. It's a brown pertex smock that packs the size of a large sandwich; it's featherlite, windproof and even supposedly breathable - and it's cut like a bin bag which means you can slip it over almost anything. They're available in the UK but any pac-a-mac equivalent will do. Of course, I wouldn't use this as my only waterproof on a full day in the hills with a threatening sky - but for most times, when the worst that happens is you get a bit damp before heading to the caff, I'd pack it in preference to coat that cost fifty times more."

"Quinn’s fourth fabulous mystery (see WALLA WALLA SUITE and HOMICIDE, MY OWN) is an excellent thriller filled with twists that keep readers wondering what next as nothing is quite like it seems. The heroine has a need to know re Krapp though she wishes that wasn’t so while the Bruno scenario just will not go away. With Beckman encouraging her to get involved and help on his case while assisting her with the calls, readers will appreciate Quinn’s adventures as she is caught in the crosshairs by The Other Romanian."

"We did a ton of baking this year, sharing with lots of folks. These are cookies that we made to take to some of our neighbors. Since we're in a ""transition kitchen"", there were several times that I would start projects and then remember that I didn't have my normal tools for the job. The night we decorated these cookies was no exception. However, necessity is the mother of invention and I learned several tricks that work great, including how to make my own colored sugar!"
"Here again I find myself agreeing with Deirdre LeFaye: it’s a collaboration (see her Family Record). The text is just too sharp (adult) and adept in its pulling out of precisely the most memorable scenes of Pollexfen’s abduction of Harriet Bryon (Vol 1, letter 29); astute observations about human nature from Grandison on a few occasions (and scattered in the original text); strong lines (“I will not be bribed into liking your wit”); and funny ones of the type we find in her Juvenilia: to me who have read Grandison and written a chapter of my dissertation on this book, the best of these is his sister, Charlotte, Lady G, explaining why Sir Charles has hitherto not fallen in love or courted anyone: he hasn’t the time, “for he is constantly going from one place to another. But what for, we cannot tell”. There are lines from from Vol 4, Letters 14 & 15, Vol 6, Letter 43 — could a child get that far?"

"Collins does a good job of building Katniss as a believable character and creating a strong, realistic bond with Peeta. The book is very accessible to a wide audience as it has a good deal of action, suspense, and even some romance for those fans inclined to that genre. Note, Collis does a good job of straddling the line with the romantic angle which could easily have turned many readers off. She never gets too sappy, but does give readers looking for romance just the right amount to keep them engaged."
"All things considered, Ghostbusters is still a abundant bold no bulk which adjustment you get. While I wouldn't acclaim the Red Fly adjustment over the Terminal Absoluteness version, if all you accept is a Wii or PS2, and you're a Ghostbusters fan, you shouldn't be aghast by what this adjustment has to offer. If I was to accord it a annual based on what I've played, I'd accord it a solid 8.0."

"Outside food sources that attract rodents include garbage, dog and cat food, dog feces, birdseed, and fruits or berries that have fallen to the ground. Take away their sources of food outside, and rodents will look for another neighborhood to live. Pick up fruit and vegetables in your yard. A honeycomb can feed hundreds of mice all winter, so carefully remove any beehives in the immediate area. Birds are messy eaters, which is especially helpful to rodents. So quit feeding the birds for the duration of the infestation. If you’re feeding the squirrels; you’re also feeding rodents. If at all possible, feed your pets indoors. If you must feed your pets outside, remove their food 30 minutes after serving. Otherwise, whatever you’re pet doesn’t eat, rodents will. Since rats are nocturnal, feed your outdoor pet well before dark."

"Victorious characters can either take over the motte and bailey, which has no peasants around it so it must be supported by raiding, burn it down, or give it to the lord they feasted with on the way to the conflict. Although there are only three horses here, characters might take the livestock, although it is stolen property, so they can never sell it in good faith. Similarly, most of the items of treasure found here should be the grave-goods of someone or other, so to keep it might prove unfortunate and Pious Saxons will insist on destroying everything they can lay their hands on."

"These eye openers, fog cutters, and morning glories came in many forms and included almost anything that could potentially soften the effects of a hangover. Therefore, the ingredients were often a matter of taste. Perhaps the chosen cure combined a bit of milk and sugar mixed with your morning dram. After absinthe became popular, it often found its way into many anti-fogmatics, mostly because of its refreshing flavor and stomach settling powers. Its extreme potency was usually tamed with some sweetener and ice. Other pick-me-ups revolved around citrus and employed its tart flavors, not to mention the natural sugars and vitamins, to help bring the sparkle back to eyes clouded over with heaviness. The truth is that when strong morning tipples were common--and we're not talking about today's tame bloody marys and mimosas--everything was fair game. An entire category of drinks, with clever monikers, was devoted to helping the masses face a new day, often in spite of the one before."

Some teachers I know had far more. All this happened when inspections lasted a whole week.

All this talk of ""shake-ups"" is happening for another reason - one to which I have alluded before."

Students engaged in this model would address academic tasks through collaboration, cooperation, and group investigations."

"5.) When I was a kid, my mom and I would often travel back and forth from Manila to Batangas. We would leave Batangas very early like 4am. To get out of our house in Batangas, we had to pass by the stone walls. It was dark but I tried my best to look at the cracks between the stones, vigilantly watching if a snake would come out of those cracks. Our house in batangas had really tall talahib grass, so it isn’t entirely impossible that there were a couple snakes in the area. Our cat once killed a baby snake under our bed. Several years after, I told my mom about this fear and she was really surprised. She said “I thought you were really brave because even if it was so dark and scary, but you didn’t say a thing.” I said “I didn’t say a thing because I was trying to be brave, and I was too busy watching out for the snakes.” I am not afraid of Batangas anymore."

File this one under both “teacher” and “daddy.” As a boy growing up in the Eighties, I learned United States geography through college basketball conference affiliation. Some glorious weekend in October, Dick Vitale’s College Basketball Yearbook would hit the local drugstore’s magazine rack, and I would giddily grab it and run to my mother yelling “It’s here today! Can I get it?!” She always said “Yes,” and the stat-ogling would begin. When I grew tired of marveling at how many points Reggie Miller or Reggie Williams averaged or at the size of the Carrier Dome or at the enrollment at Texas, I moved on to drawing uniforms and mascots. Eventually, at some point, this rural Kentucky boy would dig up a map of the United States and hunt for places like Corvallis, Oregon, or Lafayette, Louisiana. I made it a point to know all of the Division I teams, their colors, and their mascots."

"First, as a result of the summer earthquake, the dedication was postponed from August until October. And, as soon as the monument was revealed to the public, criticism poured in. For me, the first problem was aesthetic: It was not that the image of Rev. King emerging from the rock was too gray, stern or forbidding, as some critics said. (That’s just philistinism.) Rather: the whole thing just seemed too cautious and tame. First, it just isn’t very well done. Second, and more important: Is there really a point to a conventional, representational portrait sculpture in an age in which the most powerful (and eventually popular) monuments: the Vietnam Memorial, the new 9-11 memorial site, and the Berlin Monument to the Murdered Jews of Europe draw upon a more modern language of abstraction? The King monument, its very real appeals notwithstanding, could fit perfectly well in a neo-Stalinist sculpture garden or political cemetery. (Philosopher Cornel West went even further, though in a very different direction, declaring that King would have wanted a “revolution,” not a monument.)"

"This year THON raised $10,686,924.83 For The Kids. That is amazing. Almost every student organization and any other willing org. raises money for THON each year. I have never felt something so incredible. People can hate on Penn State as much as they want but nothing will ever make me doubt the pride I feel for my school. People everywhere do horrendous things each day and all of those get reported with the worst of them being nick picked at every day. However, only few people can say that they actually made a difference. Penn State makes a difference every day and brightens the life of several kids who, without the help of THON and the Four Diamonds organization may not have had a second chance at life. Despite the claims that Penn State is no longer a reputable school, we all know the truth. The truth is that Penn State will actually be remembered for its amazing efforts in helping society and not the negative events the media reports now."
"Not until it happens to you do you realise how easily you can end up in prison, and once you do, no-one will ever listen to you again. Declaring your innocence becomes denial, evidence supporting you is circumstantial and dismissed, witnesses for you are intimidated and ignored, witnesses against you are primed by police and told what to say, how to ensure the maximal sentence – and don’t forget, the worse the conviction the greater the compensation cheque."
"As for me, I have my jewels (my children.) My treasures (their artwork and handmade gifts they’ve given me over the years; family photos; and the like.) And a few things handed down to me from my ancestors–dresses from my mother, grandmothers and a great-grandmother; costume jewelry from my mother and grandmothers; a book about Paris from my grandpa; a table and chairs from a grandmother; a white trunk that traveled from England and carted the entirety of my great-great grandmother, Mary Ann Quinn’s, worldly possessions to Utah in the 1800s; and various family stories, all of which I appreciate because “Family stories make the most valuable heirlooms.” (Unknown)"

"As one who has struggled for years with the problem of war and violence in the Old Testament as well as in the world, I read the article with eagerness. I thought that this article might answer some questions I’ve had or help me clarify my positions on these issues. What a disappointment! It seemed to me to be condescending and based on false dilemmas and red herrings, as well as a selective reading of Scripture, I felt it wouldn’t have been worthy of a C as a college paper. So I dashed off a letter to the magazine giving some of my views."

"I’m a fan of a solidly made Western movie, as you’ll see in the coming days, and Silverado is a fairly .. well, it’s alright. It’s got a huge, talented cast that clearly enjoyed making the picture. However, the writing at times seems to be full of itself, like it’s trying to be all deep ‘n shit when all we want is cowboys shootin’ shit. So to speak. The conversations between Paden (Kevin Kline) and Stella (Linda Hunt) seem to hint at a long forgotten past between the two of them, but it’s mostly just air. Then there are the storylines that start and stop abruptly, as if no one would believe Paden would get together with Hannah (Rosanna Arquette) so they just picked one of the other dudes that wasn’t the black one."

"When I read this in my little book, I got teary eyed. It summed up so much of what parenting is to me. We wish to have all the answers, but in reality we learn so much from our children. To me, it's a vivid picture of the depth and weight of my responsibility as a Mother. Especially being one that has chosen to stay home with her children, and will school them within the home as well. A cloak of responsibility is what it feels like, not heavy like I'm being smothered, but rather a cloak of new identity."

"So life is made up of good days and bad days. Yesterday was a good one :) Nothing outrageous happened but things were simple, sweet and I took time to appreciate how great life is. Studio was busy, classes were awesome and lots of new members signed up!! I came home and Tanner was sleeping even though the cleaners were buzzing around and vacuuming right outside his door-he just slept like a champ(for 3 hours-he never naps that long-it was heaven!!!)!! Kevin got home early and so we walked the pups then had a glass of Chardonnay on our patio. I spent a lot of time while preggo on our patio reading and relaxing and it was so surreal to now have this amazing baby sitting on my lap bc it just feels like yesterday that I was rubbing my bump and feeling his kicks out there. Time sure does fly. We grilled up some tri tip and put the munchkin down early and talked and ate and enjoyed each other :) It was just so nice.

"I just woke up from a 30-minute afternoon nap which contained a very odd but symbolic dream. I dreamed that my friend and I rode an indoor roller coaster. Only, you know how most legit roller coasters have a safety bar or some sort of safety apparatus that holds you in the seat? In case of some deathly incident that may or may not occur? Well, this one in my dream did not have such a safety thing. It did have a small belt strap (the kind that are on the ends of backpack straps) that go across your waist. Annnd that's it."

"He fell in love with a countess named Sophie, a lady-in-waiting who wasn’t quite blue-blooded enough for a Habsburg, so they carried on secretly for two years and he refused to consider anyone else. Finally Franz Joseph said okay, but it had to be a morganatic marriage. That meant any children would have no claim to the throne. Ferdinand agreed and he and Sophie were married in 1900. Morganatic also meant that Sophie could not share his rank - on any formal occasion Ferdinand would be right next to the Emperor, but Sophie had to stand at the end of the line."

"Before we headed home again on Tuesday, Chatsworth was on the itinerary. Of course, we couldn't have foreseen the torrentialness (if that's not a word, it should be) of the deluge in which we took down the tent, nor the extent of our bedragglement as we trudged - in wellies, gently steaming as we dried out - around the most magnificent house in England. Given time, Daughter #1 might possibly forgive me for making her spend her summer holidays visiting the dead, but showing up at Mr Darcy's house looking like refugees from Glastonbury may take therapy. The house guides were very kind, possibly because we looked like people who weren't really used to being Indoors, and the wallpaper was lovely, but a bottle of water cost £1.50, which made me think rather more kindly about the warm, free water in Buxton. It is a truth universally acknowledged that a man in possession of a large fortune probably got it by fleecing tourists."
"Ended the day with some planning of my year. Because with Esteff, since she only has 3 months left she’s stressing a little with everything she wants to do before she leaves. So I was inspired to start early with my list of places to go. First things first. I need to open a savings account. For all my travelling and of course taxes. (Everyone that doesn’t know I came on the worst time of the year for tax reasons. I’ll pay the most, since I worked the whole year basically!)"
"“Vanya, come in. Bronislav.” The static remained. Kostya saw his footsteps that led him to the cave, and traced them back around the large rock formation. Trying again and again to reach his comrades. The static did not let up. He entered into the crystalline grove. The buggy was no where to be seen and the prismatic stones were all gone.

Five minutes or five years, they would always appear the same."
"I've been busy the last couple of days. Making and painting. I've been fighting a headache on and off since Monday morning, so I gave up on housework and when it subsided in the afternoons I decided to do something fun rather than cleaning. And I have a good reason to get moving on the creative front, I've committed to this Art Expo in a month, so need to get some smaller works done for my booth/stall. I've never had an art stall before, so this will be a learning experience. I'm keeping expectations fairly low, I hope I can cover my costs and learn some useful things about running a stall, and anything on top of that will be icing on the cake."

"I’ve had people tell me, “I don’t feel like saying nice things…” or “I just felt they needed a piece of my mind!” Well, I didn’t feel like getting up this morning- but I did. Why? I had responsibilities. My future as well as my current quality of life depended on me getting up and doing what I was committed to today. If we only do what we feel like doing we will never be successful. What about the morning we wake up and don’t feel married? Or better yet, what about when we don’t feel saved? The Bible teaches us that we MUST “walk by faith” and not by our feelings and emotional impulses. We have to choose to speak positive words because they are shaping and directing our lives."
"What was expected to be the depressing final chapter of a motorsport legacy, turned out to be (to the surprise of all) the blossoming of a new and uplifting chapter in the Pescarolo story. During yesterday’s liquidation sale, OAK Motorsport team owner Jacques Nicolet and Joel Rivière, owner of Prestige Racing, secured the purchase of vital PescaroloSport assets. The joint venture saw the pair acquire both Pescarolo P01 chassis, in addition to an array of assorted technical support equipment (valued at over US $550,000) crucial to team operations."
"The children and I absolutely adore the Honey Stingers. We enjoy the honey based flavors and that we aren't eating a ton of processed sugars or added soy in them. We like that they are very tasty, especially the children who beg for them. I like that they are shelf stable, small, and easy to pack with me when I know that we will need that extra boost to get me through. Three kids on a bike ride or long walk alone can be especially taxing. We take them with us on bike rides (about 3 miles) and long walks (about 2 miles) for that extra energy boost to keep us going."

One of the toughest times in our relationship was when Richard had to go away for basic training. Being away from each other was absolute torture for both of us. Although this was one of the most difficult times for us, it also made us truly appreciate one another more. It tested our love, devotion, and loyalty to each other. When Richard finally returned home we decided that there was nothing more we wanted than to spend the rest of our lives together. Nine months later, our love child, Alina Pembroke Sann was born."

"The closing, long story short, follows a legal dispute among heirs with various interests in the building at 27 Prince, which includes apartments and the two sides of Ray’s: the pizzeria and an Italian restaurant, each with its separate entrance, but sharing a kitchen and the corporation name, Ray’s of Prince Street. When the Ray in Ray’s, one of the owners of the building, died in 2008, a row arose over whether the restaurant’s lease was valid and whether it should pay rent. A lawsuit was filed in 2009 and settled this year."

In Merlyn’s Raven, love is timeless, mysterious, and dangerous, just like the dark age and land in which it’s set. I hope you’ll all come along for the adventure and share in Gwendydd’s and Myrddin’s story."

First off I have to say I am very happy about this, as I’m sure are many fans. One of the big reasons for the dislike of the ending is the lack of closure, but I feel Bioware should also look into other things to consider when expanding on this ending. I am also aware that Bioware will not see this post but am putting it up regardless."
"The surgery went well. They had to remove the colon because of where the tumor was at. The surgeon didn’t see any other cancer in the nearby organs or lymph nodes. For that we are very thankful. They will still test to see what stage it is in and if any other treatment is necessary. It was a relief to know that it doesn’t seem to have spread. Plus, without a colon, cancer cannot reappear there. She is doing well and we are praying for a speedy recovery and a good report on the test results."

Stacey’s family lived at the back of her mother’s hairdressing shop on Rotherham Terrace, Miramar in Wellington (NZ) – know the place? It had the 80′s pink and black sign writing on the window well into the 90′s. Stacey was way cool, she had the Grease record (we never even had a record player), her mum had big hair and smoked – and was pretty relaxed about things. Even when the dog ate the whole birthday cake at her party held in the salon. And she had cool jewellery, actually I pinched an orange plastic bangle from her once – I am so sorry Stace."

As a consumer, I don’t want it to be difficult to shop for products I like and find worthwhile. If I have to struggle through an endless array of cheap products to find the good ones, this lessens the value of my shopping experience and lowers my expectation of the products as a whole."

Anyone who has cared to peruse these pages or who have been clients of mine know that is not the case. I made the argument of where I stand on self-publishing and the publishing industry in my article Publishing: Advocate or Be Damned. I'll not repeat it here. I'm happy simply to say that no matter what I or others say about the complexity and difficulties that face self-published authors, more now than ever, that authors are still going to decide to self-publish. I'd just like to give them the best possible chance they can of success; by thoroughly reviewing print and publishing services and shining a light on the publishing industry as it develops and changes."

"In my group we had people from the Ukraine, Gambia, DRC, Cameroon, Pakistan, Uganda, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Jamaica and the Phillipines. Few of them had written poetry before and many were struggling with English as a second language. All of our participants were migrants, refugees, asylum seekers or undocumented, trying to establish a foothold in London and make a new life for themselves. Many people came with very difficult stories of why they had left their homes, families, children, farms and businesses behind. Some people have been here for many years with still no hope of being granted the right to stay. But everyone said that they had come to the workshop to write down their stories, to improve their English and to meet other people."
"Now let’s look at unfruitfulness. I am sure that you noticed that ἄκαρπος, “unfruitful” is the same word as καρπὸς, “fruitful” or “fruit,” with a ἄ prefix. This the same thing we do in English by putting a prefix of “a” on a word to make it mean the exact opposite. So, if we put the “alpha-negative” on the front of καρπὸς, which means fruitful, we have a word that means “unfruitful, fruitless, barren, or unproductive,” and that is exactly how ἄκαρπος is used in the New Testament. It is found eight times in the New Testament. In the parable of the Sower in Matthew 13 it refers to the “thorny ground hearer.” In the book of Jude it is used to refer to apostates who are “clouds…without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots…”"

"The designer rarely gets a credit on the acknowledgements page of the book, but they should. Their work is more visible to the reader than that of the editor or the proofreader. A useful trick for writers struggling with a book they can't evaluate is to print it out in a different font. Text looks different in a different font. The book you wrote in Arial (yuk) or Times New Roman (yuk) will look quite different if you print it in Goudy Old Style or Palatino. Suddenly, you can see the book with fresh eyes. Now - does your book suit a spindly, spidery font or an elegant, crisp font? Does that curly 'Q' really work? Do you have to change the font because of the style of one letter? (I often do.) *Now* you see what the book designer does."

Do you have any books where your own personal experience, unrelated to the story itself, left you with a less-than-good feeling about it?"

"Proficiency can be assessed the same way you assessed students under a points-based system, with quizzes, tests, papers, and projects. One difference is each particular question has anywhere from one to many learning objectives associated with it. Since students can reassess on a particular learning objective, they have an incentive to use the assessment to study for reassessment. In this way the assessment becomes part of the learning process and students will read your comments and try to figure out what they did wrong."

I can lay personal claim to having murdered Bono and lyrically shitting on his grave on at least five separate occasions."

They don’t use what’s called a SIM card, so you can’t unlock them. The US is the major country with CDMA networks, although Canada, Mexico, India, Japan and South Korea also use them. If you buy a used CDMA phone, it will have to be used with the carrier it was programmed for."

"-Hillary Clinton is unelectable. If the Democrats wish to re-take the White House they must find someone who can win in the Republican strongholds, like Evan Bayh. I must say though, even being from Indiana, there is something about Bayh that makes me question whether he’s actually presidential material. But he is a Democrat who can win in normally Republican country. Unlike John Edwards, who had zero influence even in his own home state (as was also the case with Al Gore), Bayh would likely take Indiana and swing Ohio over to the Democrats, which would almost assuredly win the race."

"Pacing is frequently a challenge, particularly for a long manga, but I think this one works despite its length largely because the cast is so diverse and complex (rather than pat standard side characters). Although there is a potential for the shojo standard reverse harem (one girl with many male potential admirers), it's generally more family-like with really only Yuki and Kyo as serious potential love interests. The side stories and complicated emotional histories of the various characters have considerable depth and, frequently, charm. Sometimes, they are downright heart-wrenching and it's somewhat intriguing to me how the author used the silly premise to highlight some key family interactions. Momiji's past (and his Tohru-like acceptance) of a horrific situation was particularly touching for me."

Well for one thing, it’s only painfully obvious that this has been ripped from the pages of a book because a) it says so in the opening credits and b) you can kind of tell with hindsight that there was probably a good few important scenes that were cut but which would have made the film make a little more holistic sense. By that I mean that characters would have been fleshed out and developed more which is a dire necessity here. Yes, there is mystery and you’re not supposed to know what’s going on but you are supposed to know what’s going on in the bits they tell you what’s going on right?"

"One of the problems we face as Lay Disciples of Jesus, is that the modern church is not structured to properly assist lay people, who are not part of the “religious establishment”, to follow the personal path of discipleship the Lord is calling them to follow. The modern church establishment does not expect lay people to enter into such individual callings. The establishment expects that any one who has such a call to either enter a seminary to become a priest, deacon, or minister or to join some religious order. It is difficult to overcome the prejudices of the past that have placed lay Christians as passive , un-empowered, servants of the clergy, having no understanding of things spiritual."

"The issue came when the recommendations were given, and only the percentage of complaints and issues were addressed. Someone didn’t do the math. If you have a 5% complaint rate for in-person reps, but you have 1000 reps, but a 50% complaint rate for 100 docs using an online tool, which one has the bigger problem and should be addressed first? If you’re a stats person without time to think, you say the big old negative one, the 50% problem one. If you have a brain, you say, uh, the rep one, because while both net out at 50 complaints, the rep has a higher chance of pissing people off long term, a higher rate of conversion when done correctly, and 100 docs on an online app doesn’t make for a decent pool for stats."
"Well, most often the answer to it all is ‘No. Yes. Sometimes’.

"I have since decided to pick up a book used in RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) that I’ve had sitting on my bookshelf for years and have been reading a bit of it here and there. The first chapter, of course, deals with God calling humanity to a close relationship with him through the salvation offered through Jesus’ sacrifice. This led me to think about the divinity of Jesus. Do I personally believe that, if Jesus existed, he was divine? Not by any means do I believe that. This prompted me to double-check the facts as to what Catholics and other Christian denominations believe as far as Jesus’ divinity goes; of course, Catholics believe Jesus was divine, seeing him as half-God, half-man, which automatically disqualifies me from even considering becoming Catholic, nevermind the blaring fact that Jesus isn’t the messiah."

"The journey that we started 6 years ago TODAY changed our lives... there were really, really bad and dark times... but there were also very uplifting, loving, and hysterically funny times.

Parker started memorizing my school schedule & would conveniently pop outside of my classrooms smoking a cigarette. At first it was a cute coincidence, but it became unattractive pretty quickly. As I said before, the difference between creepy & cute is how mutual the attraction is. And taboo or not, I was not digging Professor Parker."

I will let you do the detective work out what day that was last week! LOL. I made the tag shape too, cutting out her name and layering an off-cut from the dps (well, I don't like waste when it can be put to good use), from the front of the card placing it behind the cut-work so that it would peep through for a bit of added interest. I have written who the card is from (as if she didn't know!! LOL), on the reverse of the tag before slipping it into the pocket. The ribbon was from my stash."

"Another time, back when I was sick for a few weeks in March, I had to run across the road to drop off someone to school, and I’d just got out of the shower so my hair was still damp. I happened to complain about my illness to a Spanish woman, and she said something like, “well of course – this is very dangerous” while she lifted a piece of my hair. She insinuated that was why all my kids and I had been sick for the last couple of weeks. I was fuming but didn’t know enough Spanish to make a comeback."

"As Becky’s husband of over 33 years, I have put together for her a final health update. Only week or so before we lost her, when it first became clear how this was likely to turn out, she asked me to write a synopsis of the history of her illness, with more details about the later stages, for a final blog entry she wanted to make about this. The reason for my involvement was to save her time and effort; she would edit my draft to make it her own without the need to do all the writing from scratch. I began right away, but I did not get it ready for her soon enough. There was a lot going on, and we all thought we would have more time—probably a few weeks. However, I have decided finally to complete this task as best I can and get it posted for her at last. She would have converted it all to first person as she modified it into her own words, of course, but I don’t think I can really do that for her."
"The third cause for controversy was Þeyr's decision to perform in full Nazi regalia. Contrary to most of the other bands in the doc, Þeyr weren’t filmed during a concert. Instead, an ‘acted’ ‘music video’ was used to present the band. It shows the members goose step in Nazi gear towards the Icelandic president's house at Bessastaðir in-between shots of them rocking out in their rehearsal space (which was conveniently located at Álftanes, right next to Bessastaðir). Their Nazi get-up spurred the heated debate ""Are Þeyr Nazis on top of being snobs?"" The band of course denied all Nazi accusations. They did it ambivalently though, using the old ""it was a joke"" explanation."

"Fundamentalism has a varied history. In the early 20th century, the fundamentalist movement was responsible for directly and rightly combating the modernest heresies springing forth from within many of that day’s primary theological institutions. Yet, like the Ephesian church, while it began as a right and just movement against doctrines and practices that were contrary to Scripture, the fundamentalist movement has more recently become known more for its attacks on those within and outside the church than its love for the Lord and for his people."

"A mezzanine level around the perimeter of the cover building allows a full appreciation of the floor plan of the villa, most of whose flint and mortar foundation walls still remain to a height of a couple of feet or more. A huge number of finds are on show in display cases – from decorative beads and jewellery to more mundane finds: pottery, tools, nails, padlocks, gaming counters, household goods, geese skeletons (possibly sacrificed). And roof tiles, many of which were imprinted with foot prints of animals – dogs, cats, geese, oxen – as they lay in the sun to dry. For me, the roof tiles give perhaps the most vivid indication of what life around the villa may have been like: somewhat hectic, with animals roaming at will around a busy farmyard, geese flapping, dogs barking… And just as we gain an insight into life at Lullingstone, we also glimpse death: two skeletons are on show, one of an adult male found with grave goods in a lead casket decorated with scallop-shell detail, the other, more chillingly, that of a baby."

"The obvious problem is, of course, that such an imposition seems to violate the liberty of the students. Since they are adults, there is a presumption in favor of their right to dress as they choose. Naturally, this should match the laws regarding public indecency (although those could be challenged as well). However, provided the students are not violating such laws, it would seem reasonable to not impose on their liberty. Unless, of course, the harm done by specific attire would morally warrant imposing on the liberty of the students. This takes me to the second reason."

"How a religion formulates its relationship with pain is very telling. Is it good for you, as the older book religions sometimes suggest? Or is it something we can and should avoid, as modern society seems generally keener on as an idea?

"As the eclipse slowly covered more of the moon, I lay down under the bare branches of the birch tree, against the shadowy, dark roots spreading beneath it, closed my eyes and felt the cold earth against my back. I could almost sense the movement, the slow tilting away, as the moon fell below the horizon and out of sight, leaving the total eclipse to those further to the west."
"The day has finally came and went! It went by all so fast but so slow at the same time! The few days before, I was a bundle of nerves. Bundle of nerves is an understatement. I was a wreck. I was nervous, scared, excited, happy, etc etc.. As with anything with the Army..things ALWAYS change. As the weeks went by and the end of the deployment ended, the final date changed at least 4 times. Shoot, it even changed within the last 48 hours. He originally was supposed to be home on Sunday night around 10pm but on Saturday around noon we found out that we were not going to be seeing him until Monday morning...my heart sank...but after my initial ""down"" time, I came to accept that God knew what was best for our family and for all of the other soldiers. Monday morning is what it was going to be...but now I had 2 more days to wait! AHHHH!!!"

"But, we’d rather find the remote and turn on the TV. Why? Because it’s painless and it probably involves less change. Instead of making changes, we can just stare and watch, and find entertainment in the idea of change, without actually having the discomforts of making change. Sometimes the remote feels safer. The book is less invasive. A stranger is easier to agree with my rationale. But does it really help when things get sticky?"

Those of you from Eventing-A-Gogo may remember all the outraged backlash I received when I mentioned breeding Gogo, who was a far superior mare to Sophie if we are all to be honest with ourselves. As just a few examples, try here, and here, and here, and here, and me finally losing my marbles in frustration here. The comments on all of those posts hurt ya'll. They hurt. They really made me feel awful about myself, which is such a crying shame... I don't know any of these people in real life, why would their opinions make me feel like such a terrible person? Apparently, I am not made of as tough of stuff as I thought."

"‘Gangsters de Paris’ was the evening’s theme, a look back at some famous affairs from the beginning of the 20th century. The venue was well chosen as it is situated close to the home of the first topic discussed, the infamous ‘Apache’ gangs who stalked Belleville at the turning of the new century. Sylvanie de Lutèce was able to point out local landmarks that featured in her story, and kept the audience gripped with tales of sharp-dressed hoodlums and ‘marmites’, the girlfriends of the gang members who often gave as good as they got."

"A crack of thunder split the mottled pearl gray clouds scudding over the tops of the trees. Godl blinked in surprise, gold-green orbs wide open on the rebound. They shone like polished metal even in the dimmer light of the undergrowth. A small chuff escaped past his muzzle. Godl opened wide and bared fangs scarcely gone dull in the years since his first kill. Drawing a deep breath, he inhaled the jade scent of the forest, mineral tang of wet stone and the metallic chill of the river down below. Had the jaguar been possessed of a historian's mind, he would have recalled that first kill, an unlucky agouti Godl had pounced upon in the brush not far away. The wretched creature had squeaked loudly until the unrelenting force of Godl's jaws broke its neck."
"The music grew louder, more insistent, opposing other sound from reaching her ears. Every vibration of the melody shredded into her body unravelling her being.

"When we got downstairs, the pub was packed. ""Too late,"" I thought, ""we've lost our table"". Sitting at 'our' table and all those in the vicinity of the small room by the fire and the three Irish musicians playing were, oh, twenty-four or so wild Irish men in town for a stag party. ""No worries,"" the barmaid declared, ""they'll be moving along in an hour's time."" When we saw her deliver another round and another, we conceded defeat and chose alternate seating. Or should I say standing? I stood in a doorway, peering in and watching as the night's events unfolded."

"In the email below, sent in January of 2011, McGinniss reveals that his manuscript, then under legal review at Crown/Random House, could not prove its most headline-grabbing allegations. And yet, many of these “salacious stories” that lacked “proof” (in McGinniss’s own words) ended up in the book, and on televisions everywhere during the author’s current media tour … without proper sourcing, and without any apparent new evidence to support them."

"As I got older and became a writer, I knew I wanted to write about it. But I didn't trust myself to write a historical novel or a literary novel -- I'm not a particular fan of either genre as a reader, and I'm a big believer that you should write the kind of book you love."
"This is a must read novel! A completely different take on vampires, Fukuda has created an intriguing, captivating, fast paced novel that readers won’t be able to put down. Going into the novel, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but like Fukuda’s previous novel, Crossing, it grabbed my attention from the get go, spurring me on until the very last page, when I screamed in agony over the cliffhanger that I’ll have to live with for the next year, until I can get my hands on the sequel of this compelling novel. Alas, it’s so worth it."
"The government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concerns."
"It’s amazing that they were able to keep it exciting even for people who already read the stories. Moriarty for instance seems to be involved in all his cases, wich is a little different from the books. Overall everything is much faster and more adventerous and his deductions are slightly more obvious than in the books, but it is still so much fun to watch."
"Putting aside the overblown narrative of the record, setting aside its indefensibly bloated length, and you'd have a truly amazing record. With them (although I'm not convinced having an incoherent narrative is actually a point against it), and you have a great album that features some of the best guitar lines in the history of rock. ""Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial)"" (which I guess is about a delusional conversation with a ten-speed bike? Man, some of the songs on this record push ridiculous to new heights) has, by any conceivable measure, one of the great guitar solos. ""The Suffering"" continues the grand tradition begun in ""Junesong Provision;"" that is, mixing pop song structure with guitar-based riffing. The multi-part song expands to four sections, and starts to drag on a bit as it goes on, and it's also the first Coheed record with a Parental Advisory sticker, which isn't a bad thing so much as it's jarring, like hearing your mother say ""fuck."""

"There is something about it that is so pure, untouched — unqualified even. In the history of man, very little has been done to corrupt, or even direct the energy here, and so it can be a little difficult to work with.

"There was a bewildering assortment of false starts and incomplete sentences for the mind only. I no sooner thought of something to say to myself than I forgot it, and I was lucky to get beyond the second or third imagined word. Of course no one in his right mind overheard any of this, the dumb speaking to the silent in a reverse image, so no one was upset. But if this happens 50 or 60 times, one wants a little revenge of some sort. Of course, one was in all probability speaking no kind of written English, so this meant that whatever you said was relevant and you could not say anything irrelevant.... Reading, at which I used to be no slouch, now gave me the most incredible, disheveled experiences of my print-bound life. Now print jigged toward me, then it hung back. The one part of it that was readable swam backward or forward to render the reading experience at best incomplete, or subject to the vilest, maddest vagaries of a proofreader’s nightmare.So far I am thoroughly enjoying West's post-stroke prose, and find it much more focused and readable than Ackerman's, so perhaps I'll be content with having heard her radio voice, which seems to absorb better, and in my Amazon shopping cart I'll trade her book for The Shadow Factory."

"But it gets even more complicated, because the groundswell of the press and the people say it is so. Apparently the mystique of the Coliseum is gone. Besides the fact that Arash Markazi is viewed – however unfair it might be – as a Judas by the USC faithful, this article is extremely confused. The mystique of the Coliseum wasn’t the perceived invincibility of the Trojans on their own field, it was how the hell USC fans managed to get over their collective yawning for a few years and turn the place into a semblance of home field advantage. In that respect the mystique is gone: attendance figures are falling and will continue to fall until USC is ranked in the top ten with consistency. But then there’s this: that was the loudest Coliseum crowd I’ve heard in a long time. Ignoring the epic failures of the spirit squad’s contemptible mouse squeaks for chanting, it was a pretty good night crowd-wise. When USC exploded at the beginning of the second half and took the lead I overcame my usual attempts at civility and screamed “Choke! Choke!” at the Oregon fans behind me, then pointed at the silent away crowd in the southeastern end of the Coliseum and screamed, “It’s OK, they’re choking too!” This is very rare, and like all prodigies it foreshadowed events of great happenstance and stature, i.e. silent, glowering hatred and despair when the Ducks decided they were dangerously close to seriously messing up their points per game. Still, I was proud of the 88,000 or so fans who managed to show up and, even more surprisingly, wear red. There is still some shard of that pride left. And it was pretty cool to see the student section forget its apathy and rock out, even if it was to the way overplayed instrumental of Seven Nation Army."

"As many of you know, I have been working on a number of art collaborations over the past few years. Several of them have come to a close in 2010. One of these projects was with Vivian Bonder and Stephanie McAtee. Called Self Contained, this was an out-of-the-box collaboration that focused on feelings that we tend to hide from others and that we could no longer contain. I am happy to say that not only is our project in the January/February 2011 issue of Cloth Paper Scissors but it is featured on the cover."
"Never underestimate the Book Maven. She is very clever and has many talents. Among them is her ability as a proof reader. She has a forensic attention to detail, knows the correct word for everything, her spelling is perfect, and her knowledge of all things grammatical is second to none. I trust her above all others. She especially loves finding things that the copy editor has missed, so when I got the first proof copies of This Is Not Forgiveness, I asked her to read it for me. I knew that if there were mistakes there, she’d find them."
"As in not on the premises so there absolutely was no laborer but me? I realize my yard will never look like a magazine ad but I was hoping to maybe get enough mulch out to keep the moisture from evaporating around the bushes. Hours later I came in to get cleaned up thinking I would join friends and festivities at the local Irishman's Pub. As I was toweling my hair dry I turned on the tv and realized they were calling ""Jockeys up!"". No way could I get hair, make-up, clothing and driving to the pub done in a few minutes. So I went to fetch a beverage and watch the race thinking I would still meet up with friends for the Cinco celebrations."

"5). Justin Blackmon, WR to Jacksonville. I had Blackmon going to the Rams on the 6th pick. That was based on the assumption that Blackmon would be taken by the ”Jags” in the 9th spot. However, because they moved up to 5th, they did take Blackmon. No doubt, like the Rams, Jacksonville QB Gabbert needed another wide out to compliment Robinson. Blackmon should be able to fill the bill nicely."
"Starting this month, the ""Burnet Flea"" expanded to the second and last Sunday of each month from 7am-4pm.

"The bed was warm and toasty, the air in our bedroom was on the chilly side. I didn’t want to get up, so I gave my husband a little nudge. But he was still in a deep sleep and didn’t acknowledge the nudge.

"Furthermore, sometimes a threat is enough. For instance, in the far north of Thailand, powerful businessmen – with government connections (Thailand is an extremely corrupt society), planned to move power plant equipment across the border to a Burmese town that is controlled by drug lords. The equipment was to be used to build a generating plant that would have been fueled with dirty coal. The plant would have spread severe air pollution throughout the region (and provided electricity for narcotics factories). A large group of local Thai villagers rallied and prevented the convoy of trucks carrying the equipment from crossing into Burma, with the threat that if the convoy tried they would destroy the trucks. There was a standstill that lasted weeks but the threat worked. The trucks withdrew and the power plant was never built."

But in our legalistic society, we can’t have that one rule. We have to have a hundred individual rules because we can’t rightfully interpret the one simple rule."

As a result, you are stuck in the giant ectoplasm which takes you for a ride around the festivity."
"Now, let us consider the theory of the majority that it would be a great anomaly to have two legislative bodies, the Legislature and the President to be acting at the same time, each nullifying the acts of the other. I fail to see the suggested anomaly. In fact, under the view and interpretation given by the majority of the delegation of contemplated the simultaneous functioning of the Legislature and the President, both exercising legislative powers. And it is a fact that there were several instances of the legislature and the President both validly and simultaneously exercising legislative powers."
"Anecdote time: Shortly after I moved to New York, I was riding the subway in the Bronx, on my way to work. While sitting on the train, a woman—who was black—sat down next to me in a seat that didn’t exist. Which is to say that three people were already on the subway bench and she decided to sit down anyway, effectively squishing everyone else. Not thrilled with the idea of spending my remaining train ride getting to accidental first base with a fellow passenger, I simply got up and went to stand by the door. This woman—and I remember this vividly—then turned to me and said loudly enough for most of the surrounding car to hear: “Racist.”"

"As of now, even without this ruling, most people who are sent to death row can look forward to twenty years of appeals before their sentence is executed. That’s enough time for many relatives of victims to die of natural causes. Whether or not capital punishment is a deterrent to crime may be debated. What can’t be debated is that a toothless judicial system is an open invitation to criminals who have no reason to fear society’s retribution for any crime."
"The Dani are among the last of the lost tribes, unknown to the world until 1939, when an aircraft chartered by the zoologist Richard Archbold flew over a 6,000ft ridge above the Baliem River, and discovered a secret valley of terraced gardens, dry-stone walls and cosy little villages, populated by a people still in the stone age."

There’s no way we can say for sure. We can’t rely on the current administration.

"Today I was stood up twice by people who wanted to meet with me to get help with their spiritual life. I saw both of them on Facebook as I was waiting on them to show up. A couple that wanted help with their marriage was supposed to meet with me today, but they had something come up. Sure, these can probably be explained, but it does make you wonder about our priorities. The Bible says to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and then all else will be added to it. Somehow we think that we need to get everything else in order and then find time for God."

"MacDonald evokes the “ingroup bunker mentality” as “a fundamental characteristic of Jewish society.” So it was, and perhaps still is among many older Jews. But to fail to limn why it’s so for exogenous and millennia-long reasons, and how it parallels the same mentality in other middleman minorities, can only be seen as a telling omission. This is even more bizarre when Thomas Sowell has already done the intellectual heavy lifting, e.g. here."

"I understand why this movie isn’t well received. It’s schlock. The plot, the characters, everything about it is just low-grade thriller. And I don’t really love it for that; the acting included. As much as I like Nicholas Cage, and the role he played in moving action heroes away from the Stallones and the Van Dammes (which was a positive in my opinion), he really does feel samey in many of his movies. This movie is no exception, and apart from being a zany actor for a odd-ball role, I can’t really see any other reason to have him as the star. I would have picked another actor for this one, not sure which one but not Cage. Yeah, I understand he was made for these kind of parts, but meh. He doesn’t really seem to have any chemistry with the romance and Biel. Speaking of Biel, I don’t think I really like her as an actress. Yeah, she’s gorgeous, but you need more than that to be a compelling character, and she certainly does not bring it here. The character is one-dimensional and forgettable, and I’m sorry but Biel just relies too much on looks and not enough on an ability to act in my opinion. As for Julianne Moore, I don’t want you to think that I have something against her for this and the Blindness article but I don’t think she is good in this. Not because of her really, it seems like she was just not a good fit for this movie. I’m actually a bit surprised to see her in it to be honest. I do like her, just not in what I have talked about thus far."

You'd come home as though it had been raining, even though there had been no evidence of precipitation in the rain gauge outside the town hall."

"I turn now to 2 Timothy 4:16, 17. “At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me . . .Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me.” There is one of those “But God’s.” He knew from whence his help would come."

If the characters prevent it from hiding back in the barrow, it will seek a sheltered spot where it's body can lie undisturbed during the next month, such as the bottom of a deep stream. If it does get back into the barrow it can be killed by lighting a huge fire that covers the entire mound, as this cooks it against the hot stones."

"But more importantly, the paratextual approach can work tremendously well on a creative level. The most obvious example in the Davison era is The Caves of Androzani, Davison’s regeneration story, which gained an entire second level of buildup and suspense from the early announcement in Doctor Who Monthly that it would be written by Robert Holmes, a writer whose reputation the magazine had bolstered in its overviews of past stories. It helped, of course, that the story was phenomenally good and that the build-up to it was actually paid off by what was transmitted, but on the other hand, part of the impact the story had on fandom was undoubtedly the fact that it was built to in the way it was."
"First-time feature director Sean Durkin does not employ the standard flashback to tell Martha’s story. He uses striking transitions to move between the past and present, zooming in on an item only to reveal a change of location and time upon zooming out. The twisted logic that was fed to Martha daily has warped her perception of social norms and acceptable behaviour. Olsen does an excellent job of portraying Martha’s confusion and vulnerability. John Hawkes’ depiction of the cult leader is particularly disturbing as he brainwashes the young people around him into believing the violations of their persons and the criminal behaviour they participate in is “normal.” His interactions with Marth"

"They believed that God would help them, but for now they were in bondage. They were slaves to the Persians still. They had to pay heavy taxes of money and produce, and perhaps even military service. The deliverance prophecies of Jeremiah were not for them. This caused them great distress, but it was in this state of affairs that they had a strong faith in God and sought after him, no matter what happened. Now, remembering the faithfulness of God previously in the covenants, they would write up a covenant that they might obey God."

"Are passive sign-ups a good idea? It seems so easy and convenient to bring people into the fold in this way. You’ve got something they want – a free download, a product trial, etc – and they opt into your newsletter as a way to get a great deal. Most people don’t think too much about giving out their email address, even knowing they are signing up for promotional offers. The trick here is not to collect email addresses but rather to attract the type of person who would appreciate your newsletter. Passive sign-ups are usually only a good idea if what you have to offer via your newsletter is similar to what motivated the sign-up in the first place."
"Hello to everyone. I can't believe it is less than a month now til Christmas. I think it is really important in this crazy time of year to stop and pause for a minute and see what God has done this year in our lives. We started the year with high hopes of one of the best years of our lives, so many great things were going to happen this year.....well, they just didn't. The highlights though have been great.....the arrival of our granddaughter Alexia Laine, and some relationships restored that had been a long time broken. As for the rest if you can scroll through the blogs and get a bit of an idea."

Not surprised of course, they was using a style named ""Gesture"" I was know that but I wasn't know what gesture for. At the begining; I didn't need something like that. But now I'm thinking it's the only way to reach exactly what I need. I started to search and study about it by monday. I wasn't able to draw gesture drawing so it didn't work for me but I believe it will!"
"People may think of the Fourth of July as sitting back with a nice cold beer, and a chance to relax and visit with family. Even though I get excited about these things also, I really think of those who are serving, and have served, in order for us to have a drink and share the holiday together."
The British Imperialism in the region was simply the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. There were other pressing matters such as the constant border wars & growing land shortages. The notable consequence relating to the abolition of slavery which might have in fact played a role in causing the Great Trek was that the former slaves were now wandering all over often attacking local residents. Piet Retief only mentioned the abolition of slavery in his Manifesto in a vain attempt at getting the tacit support or understanding of the slave owning Cape Dutch. Who in fact often looked down at the Boers & ridiculed them for wanting to trek.

"Warren’s life was filled with music, being taught at an early age by his father, then attending New York Military Academy majoring in music. He was a trombonist with his brother’s band, Les Brown and the Band of Renown until he went into the Navy in World War II where he served for 3 years. Upon discharge, he entered the business end of music and joined Leeds Music in New York City. Because of his success as a “song plugger” finding hit songs for many artists and overseeing many educational projects for Leeds, he was transferred to California to open and head the Leeds Music office there. The company sold to MCA and Warren served as Vice President of MCA Music, Inc., later to become Universal Music, until his retirement in 1981. During his tenure, he found Strangers In the Night for Frank Sinatra, Girl from Ipanema for Antonio Carlos Jobin, and helped market in the USA the innovative music album Jesus Christ Super Star, Downtown by Petula Clark, and It’s Not Unusual by Tom Jones."

"The first surprise to me was the airport is adjacent to the main strip. Most cities are built first and then they had to squeeze in an airport somewhere outside of the city. Given the Las Vegas location in the middle of nowhere in the desert, there was plenty of space for an airport. Airport itself is ordinary, but I wanted to stay in the baggage claim area of airport and just people watch! What a diversity of people congregating here. There was a man and his son wearing slick cowboy hats and they had a special hat case carrier . I reminded myself i was in the southwest now, not northeast, where cowboy hats are haute couture. But, lo and behold! There are a couple of Staten Island guys sporting the gelled and sprayed ""Jersey Shore"" hair and talking on their cell phones. (Note: I did see a Snookie lookalike at one of the hotels) There were Europeans and American families, each can be distinguished by their fashion sense."

At lunch, they pick out their own meals, which all schools give free, and carry the trays to lunch tables. There is no Internet filter in the school library. They can walk in their socks during class, but at home even the very young are expected to lace up their own skates or put on their own skis."

"When we read Proverbs 31, we need to remember to jump ahead to the New Testament. Jesus - not a list of rules – makes a woman into a Proverbs 31 woman. He takes a controlling woman and teaches her to put others before themselves. He indwells the lazy woman and provides her with purpose and perseverance. He gives her the mind of Christ and instills wisdom in her over time. He breathes warmth into her cold heart and helps her become compassionate. He gives her strength in her weakness. He gives her dignity in her shame. The real Proverbs 31 woman is simply a Jesus woman."

"We could see the hotel where the wedding would be from the ferry. It was a very fancy hotel with a beautiful view of the city from huge wrap-around windows, with flowers everywhere, paper lanterns hanging from the high ceilings . . . That's a big difference with French weddings, they tend to be in small village halls here. Though I suppose in bigger cities ballrooms in hotels might be common. Restaurants are common here too, for smaller groups. Out where I live, it's usually in the multipurpose room across the square from the town hall. I feel like in the states, the venue is extremely important. Tons of flowers in lush interiors, urban lofts with ice sculptures, lights galore in a marquee in the woods. Here, the food seems to take center stage, in functional rooms with tile floors and nice but not overly ambitious decorations. And really, all of this could be regional. I have been to a wedding at a chateau, which was lovely, but there aren't tons of chateaux in the area, so maybe other more chateau-y regions have nicer reception halls. And I'll bet people who live closer to the beach in France use it for weddings. At least, I hope they do!"

"Today Junior Seau left before any of us were ready to let him leave. By all accounts Seau was a model NFL citizen. He was the consummate professional on the field and a charitable and philanthropic presence in the community off of it. But in the last years of his life he began to show the signs of instability just as he fallen brethren had. And so our final memory of him won’t be of his passion, his steely gaze as he sized up the unfortunate running back or receiver who crossed his path; it will be of an idol, alone with a pain he couldn’t share or defeat. It is maddeningly ironic that Seau’s death comes on the same day that 4 current and former New Orleans Saints players received their punishments for their roles in a bounty program designed to target and injure specific members of the opposition, injuries that could lead to the same outcome that befell Junior Seau."

"This is what God tells us in His Word – that God saved us and called us with a holy calling given us in Christ before the world began. This life on earth here is not a “contest” to see “what will happen” as the result of God creating man. Rather, it was decided by God before the world began. Moreover, we were there as God’s elect when this was “decided”. This was given us in Christ, as God’s elect, before the world began. I will go in to some scripture on that, but want to cut “right to the chase”. We see in this scripture that the purpose of this creation is centered in Jesus Christ before the world began. What will Jesus accomplish for us?? Through Jesus Christ, God will save us and call us (not according to our own works) but according to God’s own eternal counsel — His own purpose and grace before the world began. This, of course, is speaking of predestination being God working out His own plan towards His elect in grace. Yet, the scripture tells us more. The scripture tells us that this manifestation of our salvation and holy calling is manifested by the appearing of our Savior. Also, that Jesus Christ appearing abolishes death and brings life and immortality to light through the gospel. God’s purpose and grace is to save us by abolishing (destroying into nonexistence)… death… and “giving us beauty for ashes” as some say. These human bodies were made from the dust of the ground. And we know that at the Lord’s return, this mortality will put on immortality. We will gain new Heavenly spiritual bodies. We who are the elect, those called out and saved in this life, will put off this earthly tabernacle and put on the Heavenly tabernacle. We will experience the full redemption in our bodies in gaining new Heavenly spiritual bodies at the Lord’s return."

"But to weigh the benefits or demerits of James Q. Wilson’s theory should be easier. Chad Freidrichs’s marvelous documentary The Pruitt Igoe Myth (2011) brings out the core problem brilliantly. While the St. Louis housing project has become notorious as a symbol of many things—the hopelessness of public housing, the failure of liberal efforts to help the poor, and, above all, the pathology of the poor themselves—the film reveals a forgotten history. Some former residents were forever scarred by their violent experiences at Pruitt-Igoe, but others looked back on the place with great fondness. Pruitt-Igoe was a step up for many of the former slum dwellers, who had left deep poverty in the South for dangerous, cramped conditions in the city. In the beginning, the projects were a sparkling mirage of upward mobility for poor families who had never had proper plumbing or electricity. It was the “poor man’s penthouse,” as one resident declared."

I still think the job of a journalist is so meaningful that it is worth my devotion.”"
"If you know the editor well, you can be a bit chatty - ask after their children/holiday/health. Don't give a run-down of all the problems in your life even if you do know the editor well. It's not professional. What you should do, though, is alert the editor to any forthcoming events that will mean you're out of contact if they have any problems with the file or the book. So 'please check that you can open the file, as I won't be around for the next couple of days to resend it' is fine. Or 'I'm going to Borneo for three weeks next Wednesday so I'll be out of contact...' This is helpful information - if you don't tell them, you might hold up production of your book by several weeks and that won't be popular."

Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child also recognizes the contribution breastfeeding makes to the fulfilment of the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of health."

"After a week of classes, I have a few observations about going to school here. Who knows if these will pan out for the rest of the semester, but here’s what I’ve noticed thus far. First, being on a semester system rather than a quarter system, everything seems to move more slowly. Back at UW, I would already be thinking about my first midterms. Here, with 15 weeks of class, things don’t seem as rushed. Second, perhaps the professors are accustomed to Moroccan students who know English as a third or even fourth language. I say this because the amount of reading assigned for class in general is less than I would get in my classes at UW. From talking to other Moroccan students, it takes them much longer to read the same section of a textbook, simply due to the fact that I am a native English speaker and they are not. Due to these two trends, I think I’m going to have more free time than I would back home. I’m excited because this should give me the chance to join some clubs (Guitar Club, DJ Club, Explorer’s Club, maybe even Extreme Sports Club) and also tryout for the basketball, tennis, and ping pong (awesome!) teams."

As a result, we’re known for thinking sex is shameful."
"And that's something else: for a director and visualiser like Bakshi to create figures that are so plain and dull, so poorly conceptualized and so sloppily executed is not in keeping with the more solid, substantial elements onscreen. Meaning?

"If you are a local performer the best way to get your face familiarized is to attend one of the shows you hope to be booked in. Stay for the show and approach the producer afterwards, introduce yourself and express your interest in performing there. Follow up with an email and send video clips and descriptions of your act (I will go into this in more detail later). When a performer introduces themselves to me in person, it helps solidify who they are to me in my mind among a sea of faceless emails and complicated burlesque names. It also helps me to know that the performer already knows what the venue and the venue's clientele are like, and more importantly, what type of acts are booked and what type of stage (or lack of) she will be dealing with."
"To conclude, Glasman has a good grasp of what is wrong with England. He has a comprehensive understanding of the realities and consequences of a lack of political representation and the subjugation of discussion about the English question. However, whilst we should be grateful for, and take up with vigour any opportunity to engage with the political hierarchy about the necessity of freedom and fairness for England, I struggle to see how these ends can be achieved through the medium of political parties that seek only re-election and mandates of vacuous ‘change’ above anything meaningful."

Since writing about a hedge witch – or green witch – I’ve learned a lot more about this holiday."
"There has been something of a fightback from the traditional industry. They seem to have consolidated their investment around a highly focussed strategy where they spend a year building up to one big album release – like we saw with Lana Del Rey this year – while pretty much ignoring the rest of their catalogues. This is pretty clever, and it does seem to work, but it has had a bit of chilling effect on the explosion in alternatives that we saw a few years back. It’s increasingly hard for artists who aren’t interested in hoop jumping to break through to public exposure. So many magazines are only kept afloat by advertising from the industry they ‘criticize’ that they just retreat to trawling back catalogues for cover stars and saving up all their bile for people who aren’t subsidizing their lifestyles. Bookers can demand that festivals take their dull acts on Sunday afternoon as a condition of supplying their highly publicised headliners for Saturday night – effectively barring the way for better bands."

The second song for example, On The Run, although its not really what I would call a song, I never skip it, it makes the whole album sort of bind together, it tells part of the story like a stroke of genius."
Pastry Cream:
"When compulsive consumers-cum-critics praise this or that modern piece of referential art, they're pretending that they're spending a lot of time with it and that this is a testament to the quality of the material (they're making a claim then, of the art being essential, as explained above). Do not trust them, divide their claims of how much they've experienced the object of art by ten or more. If they say they've been listening to a record for two months straight, this means they've given it a half-dozen incomplete listens while surfing the internet, perhaps. The reason they're lying is because they know nobody will pay any attention to their recommendations if they were truthful about how they're using the product. Art is still sold on the basis of essentialism even when both critic and consumer do not consume the product with mind to its essential quality. The merit of art has been sidestepped, it has become at best a selling point on a marketing sheet. What is sold and bought instead, is a brief feeling of elation, belonging, an experience of something one already is prepared to experience."

"After giving up the 1 unearned run in the first, Hong pitched marvelously and to the delight of the firecracker throwing fans had a 1 hitter going into the 6th inning. He was wild though and had put 2 Senators on the bases after hitting them with pitches. Now taking the mound in the 6th Hong fell victim to the Oaks lousy fielding. A cheap infield single by Cal Lahman followed by Alex Kampouris' hit put runners on first and second. Perhaps unnerved by the developments, Hong then drilled Ray French in the ribs to load the bases with no outs. Kettle Wirts hit an easy double play ball to shortstop Greg Mulleavy but he bobbled it and a run crossed the plate with only one out. Nushida's replacement, pitcher Lefty Vinci slugged a base clearing triple and Hong was taken out of the game. Hong had lasted 5 1/3 innings, gave up 4 hits, walked 4 and got charged with 2 earned runs and was tagged with the loss as the Senators went on to beat Oakland 7 to 5."

"Another good reason is the ability to have more control over your financial decisions in tough times.

You can make the important decisions right there, instead of sitting back and worrying about whether some corporate official knows exactly what’s going on when he decides to cut costs."

"The movement of the ritual, from the centre of the camp, out into the desert, suggests and enacts the movement of impurity. The impurity is removed away from God and his people, and out of the camp. Away from holiness, and purity, out into the neutral desert. Away from order and out into chaos. An eradication of the impurity of transgression is not in view, but rather a removal of impurity from the camp, limiting the effect it can have upon the covenantal relationship."

"The performances in this movie were exactly what they were. First off, all of the bunnies (and mostly EB) were so ridiculously cute in their animation. Women will swoon. I may have swooned myself, but I’m not entirely sure what swooning is. Is that when you pass out and wake up with no pants on and covered in blood that’s not your own? EB himself had occasional moments of funniness, but almost as many occasions of annoyance. I think that’s due to Russell Brand lending his voice to the character. I’ve always felt like Russell Brand’s idea of comedy was to constantly have things coming out of your mouth and then, even if only 10% are funny or worth hearing, at least people will still leave thinking he was hilarious. What didn’t annoy me about EB was that he was a fantastic drummer. Sure, there was no good reason for him to drum in the movie, but he was animated to be good at it. James Marsden was mostly manic and over the top on his side, with a little bit of stupid mixed in, but he never really bothered me. Gary Cole was mostly an asshole through the movie."
"Now the world is imploding because their economies are in failure, I ask you, what did you expect from an illusion? Don't tell me you bought into the fantasy of unlimited growth. If we are living on a finite planet, with finite resources, for a finite period of say eighty or so years, the entire concept of infinity is meaningless. There is only one infinity and that is the infinity of the Creator. The rest is gibberish, a massive con. Something to do while we breathe in, breathe out. Unfortunately it is a con that is woven from potentially indestructible complexities and doomed to persist until everyone is converted or dead or beaten down never to rise again to expose at last the impossibility of existence in any other medium other than that of impossibly infinite growth. All this worsens in the face of climate chaos. Nothing, not even God, stands in the way, in fact, climate payback empowers greater heights of spectacular hustles as if secretly, in the black heart of the pusher, time is of the essence.

Thankfully it all came together. I think I'm alone in the wilderness in my genuine enjoyment of this long misunderstood film, which is really less of a horror film about devil cults and more a MEMENTO-style mediation on religion and righteousness. I only rank it lower than other commentaries I've done because upon listening to it, I have so many ""Um"" and ""Ah"" moments that the Toastmasters would grill me alive; I'm sure that's present on other commentaries I've done, but it just felt especially egregious here. Well, that and I occasionally lose my focus when Ms. Black chooses to take the discussion in another more interesting direction. Ultimately though, a long poortly-treated movie finally gets its due, and I got to help."

The strength of this installment of the game and pretty much the previous games of Mass Effect has always been the story and the universe’s characters. The gravity of the war and its inevitable losses are felt as you play the game. Characters die and their deaths are a sacrifice that need to be made in the hopes all living beings will have a chance at survival. At times you witness your Shepard make a stunning victory against the Reapers and in others you witness your hero/heroine watch as a race’s home world get utterly destroyed right before your Shepard’s eyes and he/she is powerless to stop it. It’s moments like these where playing for the story is truly worth it.

"Such a twisty, turny, curvy one lane primarily road through the Allegheny mountains with some spectacular views, wildflowers through the trees and even a few dogwoods still in bloom this way. BUT, I know there's always a but.....well, it was a road to travel one time. For our RV and towing a car, it was tedious as Jerry adhered to the truck caution signs and drove in low gear at no more than 30 mph on over half the way and being a courteous driver he pulled over frequently to allow vehicles and motor cyclists to pass on the one lane. There were plenty of motorcyclists on the hills and curves enjoying themselves. The road made us deeply appreciate those hearty stalwart early colonial settlers of Penn's Woods back in the early days of 1700""s and later. That anyone ventured and successfully arrived at Ft. Pitt (today's Pittsburgh) on the western side of the state through the mountains, the weather and the Indians at that time,explains a lot about the attitude of western Pennsylvanians. The eastern elite (Philadelphians) considered the westerners riff raff, not as polished, not as distinguished as the ones who remained on the eastern side. There is some truth because many of the early settlers were thieves, criminal element, etc. It was their ticket to freedom to settle the country and they took it. That roughness helped them persevere over trials on trails. All these years down through history some of that attitude prevails between the eastern and western state residents. We westerners are more the rowdies, they say."

"As all Cat Fans know, Selina made her debut way back in Batman #1 as an uncostumed jewel thief known as The Cat. She was modeled after sex-goddess of the day, Hedy Lamarr, looked smashing in an evening gown, and the first thing Batman noticed was her very shapely legs. Her first “costume”consisted only of a full face furry cat-mask, which wasn’t exactly flattering."

"In the first year alone, the note will require an $80,000 principal payment plus $24,000 worth of interest (6% of $400,000). To meet the principal payment alone, the company would need to generate $123,077 in pre-tax earnings in order to net $80,000 after tax. Adding in the $24,000 in interest, the company would need to generate $147,077 in pre-tax earnings in the first year. Given an average net margin of 5%, the company would need to generate $2,941,538 in new sales in order to make the first year’s principal and interest payment to the deceased’s estate. How likely is it for such a small company to generate $2.9 million in new sales in the year following the death of a key employee/shareholder?"

"So if the root canal wasn't enough financial stress, some boat gear is acting up. The hydraulic cylinder that controls the tension in some rigging that holds the mast up started leaking around the seal. I did some research and also with some advice from an acquaintance that runs a sailboat rigging company, I found that ""sure, any hydraulic shop can overhaul them. They just use standard seals"". So I took the cylinder to the only local hydraulic shop for overhaul. They said that they could get on it in a few days, but after eight days I called them on Thursday. They said that they would get on it that afternoon. That afternoon I got a call. They could not get it apart. The threads have galled. So with a race pending next weekend, I retrieved it and reinstalled it on the boat tonight. Hopefully it won't leak to much. After the race, I will probably send it to a ""Authorized repair facility"". And if they can't repair it, then I will price out a new one, OUCH!"

"iloveRobots is a leading developer of interactive play experiences for children, using today’s most innovative technologies. Though our products debuted in 2009, we got our start more than a decade earlier, building high-tech mobile machines at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. What entranced us more than robots’ ability to do tasks, however, was their power to inspire intelligent engagement and emotional exploration. We experimented with using what we’d learned in the lab to transform everyday experiences. The result? Robotic toys for kids that actually adapt to each interaction and grow as kids grow, taking playtime from fun to magical."

"Pertwee was educated at Frensham Heights School, an independent school in Rowledge, near Farnham in Surrey, at Sherborne School in Sherborne in Dorset, and at some other schools from which he was expelled. After school, he went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), from which he was also expelled after he refused to play a Greek ""wind"" during one of the lessons, feeling it was a waste of both his time and his father's money. He was also accused of writing graffiti about the tutors on the toilet walls. Pertwee was an officer in the Royal Navy, spending some time working in naval intelligence during the Second World War. He was a crew member of HMS Hood and was transferred off the ship shortly before she was sunk, losing all but three men. During his time in the Navy Pertwee woke up one morning after a drunken night out while in port to find a tattoo on his right arm, which was occasionally seen during his time in Doctor Who. After the war he made a name for himself as a comedy actor, notably on radio in Waterlogged Spa, alongside Eric Barker and Puffney Post Office in which he played a hapless old postman with the catch-phrase ""It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you tears them up"". From 1959 to 1977, he had a long-running role as the conniving Chief Petty Officer Pertwee in The Navy Lark on BBC Radio. He was known as a Danny Kaye look-alike, and his impersonation of Kaye can be seen in the 1949 film Murder at the Windmill. On stage, he played the part of Lycus in the 1963 London production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum with Frankie Howerd and appeared in the smaller role of Crassus in the 1966 film version. He appeared as Sidney Tait in the 1963 comedy Ladies Who Do and later in four Carry On films: Carry On Cleo (1964, as the soothsayer), Carry On Screaming (1966, as Dr. Fettle), Carry On Cowboy (1965, as Sheriff Earp) and Carry On Columbus (1992, as the Duke of Costa Brava). On television, he started off with small parts in children's shows like Mr Pastry. Later he made an appearance in The Avengers episode ""From Venus with Love"" as Brigadier Whitehead, and in the 1970s, he guest-starred as a vicar in The Goodies' episode ""Wacky Wales"". He had one of his most memorable film roles in the 1971 Amicus horror compendium The House That Dripped Blood. Filmed in the summer of 1970, between his first and second Doctor Who seasons, Pertwee played the lead in the last segment of the film as Paul Henderson, a deliciously arrogant horror film star who meets his quasi-comedic doom thanks to a genuine vampire cloak."""

"The fist group tend to be women of low intelligence and generally low self esteem, it is this group, who seem to believe that their bodies are all they have to offer, and that a woman's highest ambition is to become pregnant and get a council flat.

Instead, my job is to work with them to recognize the principles that we all want to live by, principles of trust, respect, honor, legality, and good manners. My job is to support them, to listen, to be available, and, yes, to arrange transportation. My job is to offer resources and time and nuggets and—rarely—a shoulder when one of them discovers she's made a bad choice."

"On Saturday I got dragged into irresponsible and uncontrolled pub based environments where socially irresponsible landlords want to sell you as much beer as possible due to a lack of social conscience driven by the profit imperative. Pubs are irresponsible places. There are rules in pubs. Rules about drinking in rounds, standing your round and matching your mates pint for pint, drink for drink. You can’t opt out with a soft drink, to do so makes you a puff. You have to get smashed; it’s like the law or something. Pub landlords are happy to serve you, regardless of how smashed you get, and if you find yourself in an incapable state then it’s all the fault of Tesco as the incorrect assumption is made that you were drinking before you went out. No one in their right mind would drink before meeting up with my pals. Actually no one in their right mind would drink with them full stop, but that's the way men make friends. You meet some people at school and university and these people become your friends and stay your friends regardless of whether you still have anything in common now you're all grown up. We don't really make friends as adults as we don't really want any, as the initial requirement based on childish insecurity no longer exists."

"As mobile networks have evolved, so have the phones that work on those networks. Given the complexity of spectrum allocation plans in countries around the world and the high cost of spectrum, wireless providers have been forced to acquire spectrum where it was available rather than where it was best suited to their needs. When a provider network utilized only one set of frequencies, single band phones were acceptable. Each new set of frequencies acquired by the providers required that the phones be able to operate on the new frequencies in addition to the old frequencies. Consequently, over the past fifteen years, handsets have evolved from single band through dual band and tri band phones to the quad and penta band phones of today. Some of the biggest providers in the world today are already planning for a future with 10-band and 11-band phones."

"When there are scandals and when someone is caught red handed many will respond with self-righteousness and indignance or worse (as Roxy has hinted) the unscathed will still seek vengeance like an angry mob. The concerns of those scammed are legitimate and they should be handled by professionals and authorities. For those of us who are mere spectators dealing with the aftershock, why not seize this moment for contemplation and self-critique? After all much like the ideology of consumerism, self righteousness can be a hell of a drug."

Every wrong decision I have made, every mistake I’ve made, it all leads up to this point: how does all this affect the rest of my life? Am I less of a person than I was before anyone knew about my struggles? Or am I more of a person now that I’m being honest?"

"Sexual abuse against a child is one aspect of this story, but it is not the only one. Because while this abuse was sexual, and against a child, it speaks to the larger of problem of abuse as a whole within our society. It speaks of the disrespectful, demeaning, and dehumanizing behavior we see in so many aspects of our lives. It speaks of the way so many of us have decided that abuse such as this, in many guises and many situations, is okay. We hold children to a higher standard than we hold ourselves, through coercion and manipulation. We hit kids in the name of teaching them lessons and responsibility. We distance ourselves emotionally from our children through belittling them and prioritizing our needs and wants over theirs. And we tell them that we do it all out of love."

"- “The figurative language of the prophets is taken from the analogy between the world natural and an empire or kingdom considered as a world politic. Accordingly, the world natural, consisting of heaven and earth, signifies the whole world politic, consisting of thrones and people, or so much of it as is considered in prophecy; and the things in that world signify the analogous things in this. For the heavens and the things therein signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them: and the earth, with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the lowest parts of the earth, called Hades or Hell, the lowest or most miserable part of them. Great earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and earth, are put for the shaking of kingdoms, so as to distract and overthrow them; the creating of a new heaven and earth, and the passing of an old one; or the beginning and end of a world, for the rise and ruin of a body politic signified thereby. The sun, for the whole species and race of kings, in the kingdoms of the world politic; the moon, for the body of common people considered as the king’s wife; the starts, for subordinate princes and great men; or for bishops and rulers of the people of God, when the sun is Christ. Setting of the sun, moon, and stars; darkening the sun, turning the moon into blood, and falling of the stars, for the ceasing of a kingdom.”"

Pricey some would argue for what is essentially 4 x40g portions, however, most of the ingredients would be hard to find in a supermarket (lemon infused sultanas anyone?!) and from a health shop it would probably cost you that much to walk through the door! For me, prior to losing weight, I think on average I would spend at least £5 per weekend on junk, and that would just be weekends. I never realised before, but junk is costly! For me, Graze works out cheaper than the way I was living previously, and it is a real treat to come home to on a Wednesday evening. Plus the separation of the 4 punnets means you could take one to work each day (unless you find them too irresistible and scoff them all at once – it is easily done!)"
"The human trafficking unit has laid more than 80 criminal charges, including against Styles-Lyons, since its inception."
"Russell’s spiritual others loudly dispute their concerns: “You comprehend, young man, that our energy will dissipate slowly into the mortal realm,” said an elderly man. Another responds: “It’s monotonous here, let’s do this; it would take years for the mortal’s atmosphere to harm us. That’s a wimpy excuse.” A woman’s voice speaks out: “No, they can take care of themselves.” Another voice says: “Being reborn’s our first obligation.” The first voice speaks out again: “If they fight us, we could possibly terminate.” An elderly gruff voice booms out: “Make a deal. Do this and then be reborn.” Woman’s voice: “That’s a gamble, also.” Elderly man replies: “Just want to hang out here and watch second hand adventures?” Russell grins, “Yeah…, right. I prefer you all just quietly watch. I know capable mortals who’ll help me. You know them. They won’t get upset at the sight of me and you know I’ll dodge anything hazardous. Finding these spirits will be easy. This is my assignment. I’ll agree to discuss rebirth after we return.” He pauses and the deep crease across his forehead relaxes and smoothes out; his mouth breaks into a wide grin. He settles down and nods toward his monitor. “We’ll go. I loved working on Missing Person cases when I was a mortal Detective.”"
"Manchester United slipped up against Everton at Old Trafford after twice taking the lead and are now just three points ahead of the Citizens, who have a far superior goal difference. A win for Roberto Mancini’s side will see them move to the top of the table, while either a draw or a loss will see the Red Devils take a huge step towards retaining their Premier League crown."

"We continued down the river and had five or so additional crocs put on a show for us. The last croc, that was named Bogart, was the oldest (about 70 years old) and the biggest, and even though he was missing three of his four limbs, he still came up out of the water to get his lunch. Obviously, these crocs have learned the routine for eating every day."
"By the time I got closer to the stage area J.Pinder was on deck rocking cuts off his Careless project. Pinder performed a very tight and solid set so I stepped to his table, bought a tee-shirt from him directly and took a few photos of the cool brotha. I missed out on Ad.D’s set since they rocked first, while I was out in the rain holding a wet joint, lol…Thx to Edot from T-Dot."

"So where, along the way, did it become acceptable for fans of one lot of eleven people who kick a ball to mock the tragedies of another?"
"Talking of mean, I mean…why didn’t the photographer have the heart to tell me that grape really isn’t ‘my’ colour and that pouchy pockets on a blouse isn’t a great look on the well-endowed and that what I thought were nice jeans look like jodhpurs? And that skinny jeans really should be tucked into boots, not dragged over them. Men, huh?"
"In fact, the introduction of “racism” might sometimes introduce a complicating factor. Stabbing someone constitutes violent physical discrimination in any case. The automatic assumption of “racism” can easily be a false trail. So while offensive language might be a useful guide as to whether a crime was racially motivated, it should, in my opinion, be seen as one of a number of factors, to be corroborated before any final conclusion can be drawn."

"Although the ""dogmatic disbelief"" of these intellectuals remained ""intolerable,"" the religious tenets of his own lukewarm Protestant faith were equally unsatisfactory. Eventually his insecurely held faith, a remnant of childhood, ""just dropped away… as easily as a child loses a first tooth."" By the winter of 1893, he was an avowed agnostic, ceasing all church attendance and declaring to friends that he ""didn't believe in a Christian faith."" This was his state of heart and mind when, in 1897, he first made the acquaintance of Belloc."

"Growing these plants is one of the most space and work efficient ways to grow your own food. Although the mounds require quite a bit of space between them, growing several plants per mound means more plants overall. The lower space in between often acts as swales or berms in which the water collects and soaks into the ground. I'm growing them in a hex pattern this year, in an attempt to fit as many mounds into my small garden as possible. We'll see how it works."

"Burke also hints at the fact that if ‘six million Muslims of France’ were really radicalised – then France would certainly know about it. Is it really that simple? The population of France is still, I think, around sixty million. It also has an army, a strong police force, a security service and all the rest. Taking into account all these things, even a sizable minority of six million Muslims would still think twice about an overwhelming show of force against the French Government or against the millions of non-Muslim French citizens. Radical Islamists know that because there are no mountains to hide in, as there are in Pakistan and Afghanistan, an overwhelming or systematic attack on the French Government, or the French people, would be pretty unwise, to say the least. It would quite simply be crushed. Thus small acts of terrorism and the rest is all the Islamists have to go on in France and indeed in the UK. Anything more than that would simply backfire. So what is Burke expecting these radicalised Muslims to do (even if we take them to be radicalised)? Even one million radicalised Muslims would not be foolish enough to take on a centralised government, with its army, police, etc. and a country of sixty million people. And, as I argued before, it could be the case that there is a million radicalised Muslims in France (or England), but even then only a few thousand or so would be actively radical."

"The land grab for agriculture for corporates have another drawback. Suppose that they buy the land today for farming but later turn it into a real estate project, could they be challenged. The contract would say that they brought the land and are landowners and could do anything with it. Forgive me if the words come out strong but that would be an exact replica of colonial time (which we as nation tried to forgo in our independence struggle), by using terms like modernizing and upliftment as proxy to get the job done. One feels the approach is not right. There needs to be a policy which needs to be planned where the local population which is living there does not feel thrown out, by being arm twisted on the bases of using various exploitative laws."

"Everything was done as usual. The pack of cards was an old one. The cards were shuffled, cut and dealt as normal... ""We play regularly and are always very careful to make sure the deck of cards is shuffled repeatedly. I don't mean to sound churlish here, because they surely deserve their moment of fun and fame, but mathematically every other set of hands they were dealt that night would have had the same probability of occurring.

"Hell, even if you're not in a couple, it may take a few tries before you get it right. Go out too much, and you stop sleeping. You're overstimulated to the point where everything is boring, you've tried every restaurant and every bar, you've seen God knows how many bands, and they all kind of fade into the same neon-lit horizon. Your culture knowledge does become staggering -- I know people who are little walking encyclopedias of indie bands, sleeper films, and hidden food trailers -- but it gets harder to hear yourself think."

We met his wife at the hospital and headed up to see Shaun. Although being somewhat uncomfortable, he seemed ok, still not really with it, but much improved."
"The second half of the show was dedicated to vintage evening dresses and gorgeous, daring lingerie. The only way to describe the underwear (from La Perla, Lascivious and Princesse tam.tam) is decadent and sexy – a parade of black lace and navy satin. The models looked stunning and walked with confidence, helped in part to their gravity-defying ‘dos from Artizan, and while most of the lingerie featured was out of my budget, if it came with a washboard stomach and curves in all the right places, I’d definitely be buying! : ) The vintage dresses included a mix of short 60s shift dresses and longer numbers, like the white 70s Grecian feather dress that floated down the catwalk."

And once all my stuff is IN the basement, I abandon it to stand out in the front yard until I’m bound to be swept away like Jonas’s truck in Twister. I know I can get into the basement fast, but it takes a little prep time to gather the items that mean the most to me. The pack has changed throughout the years based what’s important to me at that juncture of my life. SO here are my survival packs throughout the years:"

"Are nurse managers doing the best they can when it comes to hiring new staff? I suspect not all would answer in the affirmative. The next question is are all prospective nursing employees portraying their skills and experience accurately? When new nursing staff join any particular area of a hospital they become the focus of attention. A new face, a new name that is essentially unknown amongst the already present staff. Reality dictates that several judgments are being made early in this introduction. For the new nurse that is joining the group there is a lot of trepidation about learning the ropes and fitting in. The biggest hurdle that new nurses have to negotiate is the perceptions that are developed about them by the already present staff."

"Power was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914, the only son of Helen Emma ""Patia"" (née Reaume) and the English-born American stage and screen actor Tyrone Power, Sr. Power was descended from a long theatrical line going back to his great-grandfather, the actor and comedian Tyrone Power (1795-1841). His father's ancestry included Irish, English, and Protestant French Huguenots (the latter through his paternal grandmother's Lavenu and Blossett ancestors). His mother had Catholic French Canadian (through the Reaume family) and German (from Alsace-Lorraine) ancestry. Through his paternal great-grandmother, Anne Gilbert, Power was related to the actor Laurence Olivier; through his paternal grandmother, stage actress Ethel Lavenu, he was related by marriage to author Evelyn Waugh, and through his father's first cousin, Norah Emily Gorman Power, he was related to the theatrical director Sir (William) Tyrone Guthrie, founder of the Stratford Festival (now the Stratford Shakespeare Festival) in Canada and the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota."

"I tried living my life without this sport and I can’t do it. It’s too ingrained into my muscle memory and my heart. No other workout provides the same level of full-body involvement for the duration of the exercise. It’s such a challenging, rewarding, and thrilling sport that taps into the dancer and artist in me. But it also is the only kind of exercise I’ve ever experienced that is so fun that I don’t think about the fact that I’m exercising; I’m only focused on trying to do the spins, jumps, or edge moves that I want to be able to do. I can’t encourage people enough to give it a real try. It’s so fun. When the cool air whooshes past my face as I skate around the rink, I feel exhilarated and joyful. Yesterday was my first day back on the ice in a month due to a sprained foot and being back felt so good that I had a really stupid big grin on my face the whole time."

"Considered solely for the romance between Thornton and Margaret Hale, you might say it’s a more serious version of Pride and Prejudice insofar as we watch through the heroine’s eyes as she hates him at first sight and reluctantly but completely changes her mind throughout the course of the show. It’s not an easy sell. I’ve seen the series about 12 times and each time Thornton’s early brutality, as well as his strange subsequent self-revelations about his family’s past, make him an oddly moody brute of a man."

The other conspicuous absences in my childhood were cookbooks. Indian recipes, as is well known, are usually passed down as oral traditions, or on scribbled bits of papers. Even today, I rarely see mum referring to a cookbook. She actually gets amused when I try and pin down quantities so I can write them up for the blog. Her usual method of explanation goes along the lines of 'well, add a handful of this and a pinch of that, and a spoon of this and a couple glugs on that'. Yep, helpful. Not! On ocasion I saw mum using a recipe that was found in a local weekly paper. But we never had those glossy coffee table style cookbooks that everybody seems to own now.

It is then, that it hits me. Some people have kids to complete their families. Or to start a boy band they can sell into indentured servitude on the Disney Channel. I had them for material. Seriously? It’s a little hard to believe Letterman and Leno need a team of writers. Then again, they are rich and famous and I’m not. So they probably know something I don’t. However, if you have kids and you can’t laugh, you’re spending too much time on your iPod, iPad, or iHaveSoMuchToDoICan’tHearAWordYou’reSaying.

While it’s clear from the beginning (there’s even a proposal of marriage met with the fact that Philip isn’t proper – not that Cleone doesn’t love him), that Philip and Cleone are in love and what not – there is a rival. This rival, Bancroft, represents the ‘change’ that Philip must undergo to have Cleone – hopefully – realize he is fit to marry.
How do I decide which of the conflicting imperatives is more important? People don’t like this idea, because they don’t understand it: They think it is immoral to give priority to the defense of the citizens of your state over the protection of the lives of the neighbors of the terrorists. They don’t understand that the world is built in such a way that responsibility is divided.

A brief synopsis. I'd just divorced. I was single, alone, my daughter in my ex's questionable care. I was lonely, scared, unsure. So, I seized the outstretched hand of a friend who lived about 120 miles south, in Baton Rouge. He was single, intelligent, creative, and a good friend to help you forget about your woes. I spent several months of weekends driving down to Baton Rouge to stay with this friend, travel around, ride bikes all over town and country, tour the USS Kidd which he was a tour guide on, and in general try and fail miserably and repeatedly to pick up girls.

A few hours after I watched “Mirror Mirror” someone asked me what I thought of it and my response was “Snow White was a little hottie!”, and I must admit I was quite taken with newcomer Lily Collins. Collins is very charismatic and gives a nice performance as Snow White. She’s sweet and lovable and you can understand why the Prince falls for her and the Queen loathes her. Even one of the dwarfs quickly develops a strong attraction to her (the other dwarfs obviously love her, too, but not in the same way). Collins, the daughter of Genesis drummer and vocalist Phil Collins, shines bright in the movie and will no doubt be a star to watch over the next few years.
There's no particular reason you should know Davis, but if you know my work on moonshine, you've felt his touch.

"I was looking at the new Kindle Fire which looks cool because you can download books and movies and music and it's in color and it seems fairly reasonable in price. But just this morning I read an article that said it works best with Amazon Prime, a $79-a-year subscription that gives you easy access to all those movies, books and music. And all of a sudden, it doesn't seem so reasonable anymore. Granted, $79 a year factors out to about $7 a month, which is a cheap price, but I already have a Netflix subscription for movies, basic cable (about 20 channels) for TV shows, not to mention those hundreds and thousands of books. Do I need to add all of this extra content? No. Not really. But again, I could use the fun money fund and afford to get both the Kindle and a one-year subscription to Amazon Prime and it would be no skin off my nose (it was all gifted money), I'm just not sure I should. (And to clarify: all of my other funds take care of bills and things, this really is just ""fun"" money.) I could of course forgo the Prime and just use the Kindle to download the free classics but that takes some of the fun away from it I think, which is the whole point of the fund."

"The base is some gorgeous Bazzill from their 'Wedding' collection - it has a soft sheen like satin and has a very soft stripe through it. Then I topped it with some silver card. I used some foam tape to pop the whole square layer on top of that - a layer of Sage Shadow and some more Bazzill from the 'Wedding' collection - this time it still has that soft sheen, but it is covered in embossed butterflies!! Around this layer I've added some 1 inch white grosgrain ribbon, some sage satin ribbon and then this gorgeous sage and white rose braid that matched perfectly!! Then I tied some white organza ribbon into a bow and added some silver cord and a white rose bud. The main panel I stamped using the Just Rite Stampers - the Brayton Font and the Rectangular Block - in black ink. The '&' is from SU's 'Together Forever' set and stamped in Sage Shadow. (Thanks HEAPS to my BFF Edna who let me borrow her set!) It was cut out using the Label 1 Nestabilities dies and then it was glued to some Sage Shadow card and I hand cut a fine edge around it.

We can't even envision the ""homeland"" of which the author of Hebrews 11 speaks without having been given the category by living in, and being removed from, a homeland on earth. The ""place"" of our life awakens in us the desire for its fulfillment. Our ""place"" teaches us what home could possibly begin to mean. It is all important that we are passionate about ""place,"" or else we seek some disembodied spirit world that only the Gnostics could love."

Johnston was replaced by Gen. John Bell Hood who launched poorly coordinated and futile attacks on Sherman's forces, decimating his army and losing Atlanta in the process.

"The title of the new season of BIGGEST LOSER is NO EXCUSES ... What a great title !!! We can find an excuse for anything we want, but the TRUTH IS that God knows all of them and is just not buying them - He did after all send his son to the cross for us ... He knows us more intimately and deeply than anyone ... Our fears and reservations just spill out to him ... WE CAN HIDE NOTHING ...."

"'Cloaked' is unlike 'Beastly' in that it does not incorporate only one fairy tale into the plot. While I had heard of the story of The Frog Prince, there were six other stories weaved together which I was unfamiliar with. The way in which all these classic tales came together to make a new one was interesting, compelling and most of all, fun."

"Nottingham plays up its connection to Robin Hood, although he really only came here in raids – surely they should make more of their infamous Sheriff. Maybe a Sheriff Trail rather than a Robin Hood Trail (which doesn’t really relate to any of the buildings it is traced around)."

"Instead of taking Mikayla to meet Santa for the first time, I take Jonathan alone. And as he climbs up on Santa's lap, I get a tear in my eye thinking of what should have been. I cannot help myself. I try to do all of the things that everyone expects me to do, but I just cannot seem to do them with a true joy in my heart. It's not that I don't desire for my feelings to be different, I want to enjoy all of the usually wonderful things about this season, but I am just having a difficult time figuring out how to do that most days."

"The year 2012 is a milestone for me. It marks 40 years since my first job in the field of developmental disabilities – 35 of those have been with the same organization. It’s hard to imagine a more vibrant piece of this field’s history than the one since 1972. The I/DD field of the 1970s (probably inspired by the civil rights era of the 1960s) saw an explosion of activity; the birth of countless community options, the expansion of education and research, the emergence of whole new professions and specialties. And, there was money. In 1971, federal dollars flowed in the form of funding for ICF-DDs and the eventual waiver programs that followed."
"I love that he did this song! I love that he openly pens his love for black girls and I love that it’s causing controversy because it’s bringing awareness and opening dialogue about interracial relationships between white men and black women and the desireability of black women. But the one thing I love more than the controversy and the attention is that other white male celebs are jumping on his twitter and voicing their love for black girls too. By them doing that, it sends the message that there is nothing wrong with voicing it publically! Say it LOUD. I LOVE BLACK GIRLS and I’M PROUD!!!!!!"

"The new pantry configuration is a combination of solid shelves on one wall and ventilated shelves on the other (all the way up to the ceiling!)

"On Wednesday, I wrote about my belief that Christians need to rediscover that profound fast which Lent was once known for. In the same post, I also briefly mentioned the old tradition - but one that was new to me - of eating pretzels during the Lenten season. It seems that these savoury snacks were especially invented for the purpose of fasting during Lent - as a replacement for luxury foods."
This is the place I called ‘home’ for many months.
"The dong on Wednesday was little changed at 20,630 per dollar as of 2 p.m. local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The VN Index on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange tumbled 4 percent today and is down about 20 percent in 2011, the biggest fall in Asia."
"The problem with this opening scene is that it makes the Doctor’s army seem a bit weak by comparison. I’d have loved to see the Doctor have to compromise his own beliefs and convince the Cybermen to fight for him against the clerics instead of the Doctor going around and grabbing a bunch of people we haven’t ever seen before. There’s a Silurian female living in 19th century London and a Sontaran male forced to serve as a nurse and it really does come off as, “Hey, we’ve got a Silurian and Sontaran costume ready to be used!” instead of needing these people specifically. Captain Avery the Pirate from CURSE OF THE BLACK SPOT and “Danny Boy” from VICTORY OF THE DALEKS show up for a brief scene, but I would rather have seen these characters and Canton Edward Delaware III get the parts the Silurian, Sontaran, and fat, blue guy get here."

"I didn’t know what to say. I took the books. Inside the bag was Emma. He had also included Fitzgerald, Wilde, Salinger, Dostoyevsky, Dickens, Gogol, Brontes, Verne, and Bradbury. My mom laughed at the load I’d been given because up to that point, reading was not my thing. I could comprehend (I have always blown away proctors when taking comprehension tests) what I was reading, could read quickly, but found no enjoyment in it. As a teacher, I think she secretly hoped that Mr. Cartegena’s plan would work. It definitely changed my life."

I absolutely loved having our three children home - I lived for summer vacation even more than they did. But alas, they are all grown up now and so the end of school no longer holds the same appeal it once did for me. So I guess I will say the warmer temperatures and the opportunity to open windows and bring the outside in."

"Unfortunately Marko has decided to stop using the potty. I don't think it's just because of the new baby, because he was fine the first week. But with no one available to keep track of when he might need to go, physically lead him over to the potty, and sit down and read to him until he goes ... he's just not into it. If I just call from the couch ""please sit on the potty!"" it does not work at all. And he just doesn't seem to know when to go on his own. After the time when he peed on a stack of library books, and the time when he begged to be on my lap and peed on that, and the time when he sat in the baby's carseat and peed in that, I finally decided I was done with this, for now. I don't mind cleaning puddles off the floor -- it's a heck of a lot easier than changing a diaper -- but they don't always end up on the floor, but the couch, the clean laundry, his toys .... you can imagine, I'm sure. So I put him back in diapers."

"It took all I had to not turn around and to refrain from breaking into a run. It seemed imperative to be confident, to not show fear, to NOT turn around, though I was tensed for the smallest of noises which might indicate that they had even merely turned around to watch me go, their prey; I consciously identified as “the prey” during this ordeal. I heard the single crackle of a twig but I did not turn around, instead I laughed into the phone at some pretended bon mot. The tension was achingly palpable and I feared that to run would blow my confidence act and trigger a chase, if they sensed fear they’d know I was meeting no one on the trail, my charade would collapse, so I continued the “call” all the way to the parking lot and then, suddenly, I was running to the car, shoving Jamoka in the back seat, and hitting the button that locks all the doors."

"We opt for a high-end electric toothbrush that we received for a wedding present ten-plus years ago, but use manual toothbrushes for trips and camping. Environmental Toothbrushes is a company out of Australia (another awesome eco-place to be) that has put together compostable toothbrushes! The handles are made from one of my favorite renewable materials – bamboo and the bristles are a polymer that’s resistant to bacterial growth. The brushes come in medium and soft for adults and a child’s size, too. Beckett gets a kick out of having a “wooden” toothbrush."

"There are three things in this life that I truly love – eating, drinking, and my cat. Two of these I get to incorporate into my college life. The latter, a long distance relationship that leaves us both with strained hearts, I am sure. I indulge in breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, and dessert nightly. Dessert, according to Merriam-Webster, is a sweet course or dish usually served at the end of a meal. Thus, my vodka-sprite, my vodka-cranberry, my beer, and my occasional chocolate bar. I sometimes break the rules and spoil my appetite, consuming dessert before dinner. But I was taught growing up this is wrong, ill-mannered. So I do my best to hold off until the latter is taken care of. Always surrounded by what I love, I am a rather happy, rather successful student."

"If black is in fact the absence of colour or light, then silence is the black of the auditory realm. Quiet you can hear, but this was the complete and utter absence of anything – and I can’t stress that enough. Very occasionally you could head a distant moo of cattle or squark of a pheasant, but that only heightens the lack of sound the rest of the time. Nothing happening, the world just Is. It lifts everything from your shoulders, the world is put on pause… it’s wonderful."

"this is to confirm that the rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated, I've just been so busy with real life and my blog pays the price. am writing this in a rare spare moment before I rush to meet with my mom in south ken (planning on checking out the hummingbird bakery, about time!)."
"Not much else to tell you really as, apart from doing educational things with the children and shuffling around the caravan wheezing and taking up space, there isn't much left to write about! Oh, the house-spider season has started officially. I was sitting on my bed this morning when a large one came legging it over the top of my bolster cushion and across the duvet! I am A LOT better about large spiders than I used to be though and I'm not sure if this is because of the therapist I went to see in 2004 after nearly killing myself on the stairs after finding a spider under a cuddly toy, or because of my children, who are pretty relaxed around spiders. When the children were little, I used to deliberately go on ""spider-finding-missions"" where I would find a garden spider and show it to the baby/toddler and point out all the pretty stripes and colours and give it a cute little voice! Likewise, I used to try to hide my terror when finding a large spider in the house as I really didn't want to pass this phobia onto the next generation. Anyway, it worked and now I have children who can safely catch the big spiders and take them outside for me and watching the children being relaxed is slowly making me feel happier. All the same, I'll be glad when the spiders settle down into their Winter homes and stop dashing across the floors and surprising me in the shower!! Eeek!!"

"There are times in our lives when the storm moves through quickly, other times when it seems to settle around us and rain for months. Sometimes, we continue moving ahead, slowing a bit perhaps, but still focused forward. There are other times when we need to wait upon the Lord, praying that he will give us greater vision and wait for him to clear the way. It is seldom in life that we gain greater advantage by pushing blindly ahead, not compelled by faith and wisdom, but driven by the stubbornness of our own determination."

"First consider expenditure growth. People, 1985 - 2009 is 25 years. 48% growth over 25 years is, at a first approximation, something like a 2% annual growth rate. That just doesn't seem so bad a rate of spending increase. It's clearly below the rate of growth of real GDP. Is that really the same as the health care case?"
"Going from relaxed to natural hair can be an exciting, liberating experience, and there are two basic ways to get there. The fastest, no nonsense way to go natural is by simply cutting off all the relaxed hair in one fell swoop, or big chopping. But big chopping can require a strength that not everyone is equipped with at the outset of a hair care journey. For some, deliberate transitioning (complete with mini chops) is a necessary part of the “back to natural” process. And, if we really look at it, everyone who makes the journey must transition. Whether you big chop on day one of your thought, or a year after the initial thought, transitioning always starts with the mind well before any actionable steps are taken. In some circles, however, transitioning— especially long term transitioning, is seen as a sign of weakness. I argue, quite the contrary!"

The pearl trim and the brads on the sign are the only elements that weren't part of the wonderful kit this month. It's so much fun choosing what to use for a card from all the fabulous things that are included in each kit. If you haven't figured it out by now, I am LOVING these kits!! Give them a try, because I know you will, too!!"

"Both of these sides of the coin – the ineffectiveness of our ‘correctional institutions’ and corruption in the juridical process combine to ensure there are more victims. Not just from people who offend a second time, but also people who cannot, or do not dare to seek help before they commit a crime. How can you ask for help when the system will simply mark you as dangerous and then systematically take your life apart?"
"Mum is back in hospital after falling, her carer found her yesterday morning, she must have fallen before going to bed and had been on the floor all night. Apparently she managed to say she wanted the paramedics and to go to the “nice” hospital! I met her at A&E and they ran lots of tests. Last night we saw the doctor who went through everything. She is quite poorly, with lots of different things wrong which is worrying but she is in the right place and they really do seem to want to get to the bottom of it all."
"I wanted to continue with all that softness, so I chose to use flannel for the back. The top of my quilt was a little too small for a twin size, so I took a large flannel sheet and cut it down. I used the part I cut down for a border on the top. And the rest of the flannel sheet for the back."
"Magdi Cristiano Allam gave this opinion. Instead of proclaiming Christ to the Muslims, Europe responds to the phenomenon of Islam which takes religion seriously, with a ""reinforced religious relativism"" says Allam.

"One of the fun aspects of the course has been shooting weekly assignments. Every week the instructor would give assignments and each of the students were left to their own devices to fulfill the requirements. First assignment, we shot flowers. The flower assignment was easy enough. How could it be difficult, shoot some flowers and share them with the class. Next up, portraits. Again, cake assignment. Snap some pictures of people’s faces. Boom, boom, boom. Done. After finishing up the first few weeks of the course I felt pretty confident in my abilities as an amateur photog. Give me a concept to shoot and I am creative enough to come up with something that will both fulfill the assignment and give it a certain flair to make it my own."

"Your loved ones, your society, your religion, your constitution, your organisation, and your community - everyone wants to play the role of a painter in your life. There is no point in placing your life in someone else`s hands and then cribbing, crying and sobbing that you are not happy with your life. An obedient painting should gleefully accept what it has become, for it had chosen obedient surrender to its painter. Else, snatch the brush. They had their life and if they have missed the chance to paint their life it is their missed opportunity. The canvass of your life cannot be used for their experimentation. You may not have the genius of a Leonardo da Vinci, but it`s okay. Make the strokes you can; scribble; at least what comes out will be your making. Then, your life becomes your responsibility.

"6: Having failed with the ring-sling I decided to try the other option; the soft-structured carrier. Again, I researched all the different brands (and there are loads!), eventually settling on an Action Baby Carrier. I still own this sling, and I’d recommend it. It’s very comfortable for a front-carry, and quick and easy to get on. It has a sleep-hood that can be lifted if your baby falls to sleep to support their head. It’s just a really comfortable, everyday carrier."
"Bottom-line: 2012 outlook for global brands remains steady in China. On the retail side, insiders see a continued steady growth around 20% for the mid-to-upper level and luxury segments. The implication here is for local brands to continue to underperform for the balance of the year. In the end, 5% overall growth is still in the picture. Good year for Japanese in China, not bad for US, Korean and EUR brands."

"This is a black book I have. I started to write down dates that I had disturbing dreams – trust me, there are plenty. Eventually I began writing small snyopsis of the dream. I was trying to find some pattern. No pattern evolved over the five years that I religiously kept this list going. I did find though was pretty disturbing – things I was dreaming of were happening. So guess what I did? I listed this, every time something happened that made me think of a dream Id had I would note in the dream book in another colour under the dream. I wrote the date and what had happened. I think I began to scare myself so I stopped writing the dreams down."

"Saturday was tropical in weather and the girls and I started out in the sun by 11 or so. I ran in to get ice with Mist and encountered a grouchy store lady!! I will refrain myself from that story ;-) The day was incredibly heavenly! I could have stayed on that remote beach forever. After reading a few Voice of Victory articles to the girls, we had a delicious lunch of sauteed chicken and veggie tortillas. There we were all laid out in bikinis with the men off fishing and kids playing in the water. Matthew came back just as a helicopter flew over us. Then it flew over us again. Then it flew over AGAIN. We all started wondering what was up. Then it CIRCLED us!! ""What do they want to look at us for?"" Catman demanded to know. ""They weren't looking at us, Buddy"" Matthew told him."" ""Why would they want to look at girls in bikinis?"" he asked skeptically. We all laughed....... Guess nothing is all that secluded ;-) We girls swam out to the edge of the bay several times and hit the cold and waves of the great lake beyond. It was like time stopped and we were caught in a supernatural plain of some kind of heavenly sphere. The warm winds, the sand and shore, the cold waters and the waves, the mammoth mountains and the great boulders reminded us that we were but tiny creations living in this Eden that God Himself created for his children to enjoy...... That evening a great storm came up from out of no place and all us women and kids huddled in our trailer telling silly stories as the rain and hails passed us by. In an hour or two it was calm again and the men emerged soaked and fishless for the most part."

"I learned about healthy anger that alerts me to the presence of a problem that I need to deal with. Now, it also took practice to know where, when and how to express it. Sometimes, outside the hospital and the Anger Management room, I’d get angry and express it inappropriately. Caused some embarrassment for my family a few times, which I regretted. Eventually I learned to get it right, at least most of the time. The old adage, “Practice makes perfect,” is not really true, as my daughter’s orchestra conductor taught her. Instead, “Practice makes permanent, and perfect practice makes perfect.” So when I’d get angry, I’d slow down before just acting on it. I’d think about where, when and how to best deal with it. I’ve gotten better with it over time. Occasionally I still express anger inappropriately, which means I’ve gotten really good at saying I’m sorry and asking for forgiveness."

"Pete used the James reading to speak of how the Church has so frequently been hypocritical in the way it treats the rich in preference over the poor, he reminded us that we all have our blind spots and justify our failure to love our neighbour as Christ commanded us, with all kinds of very reasonable reasons which, if we thought about it for a moment, betray the Crucified Christ and all his teachings. I was taken particularly by a poem Pete read by Studdert-Kennedy (see below) and it was the image of Christ crouching against a wall in the pouring rain that inspired the picture."

The film was a major critical and commercial success, and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards. Additionally, the film gathered critical acclaim at several international film festivals, in addition to winning many Indian awards, including the National Film Awards. Khan himself won his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. After four-years of break from acting, Khan made his comeback with Ketan Mehta’s The Rising in 2005, and later won a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance for his role in Rang De Basanti (2006). Later on he worked with Yash Raj film “Fannah” in which he played a negative role with Kajol as his love interest. In 2007, he made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par, for which he received a Filmfare Best Director Award. In 2008 Khan appeared in the movie Ghajini. The film was a major commercial success and became the highest grosser of the year while this year he will be seen again in Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots with Kareena Kapoor."

"The parallel between today’s debate over homosexuality and earlier debates in which the Church was eventually forced to acknowledge they had erred is striking. We’ve already witnessed a global shift in this debate in that those few passages often quoted to claim the moral abhorrence of same sex relationships are now being reinterpreted by steadily growing numbers of evangelicals, Bible scholars and others, just as texts have been reinterpreted in the case of slavery, the ordination of women and a host of other issues. For those under the age of 35, same sex marriage is not even an issue."

"Investment in foreign land by large companies, or land-grabs as they have become known, have drastically increased in popularity since the beginning of the millennium. The majority of these investments have taken place in Sub-Saharan Africa where vast amounts of land, up to 90 percent in fact, is owned by the state rather than the individuals that live, work and die on it. This makes it easy for governments to sell this land to foreign companies looking to start up business, most of which is agricultural, in the area."

"There are only about fifty Honus Wagner's cards but most of them are in poor condition. Wagner did not want his image on a tobacco card and was therefore removed from the set which already make his card harder to obtain. The book is about the one known as The Card.

You can refinish classic antiques and paintings get retouched but baseball cards must not be altered. There are card doctors who remove stains, smooth out wrinkles, build up soft corners, change memorabilia patches, and laser rough edges. The book explores the serious doubts about the authenticity of The Card and its current condition."

Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit.

However, I must also admit that this was an incredibly frustrating book, and if I must compare to his other books, this is probably my second least favorite of anything of his I’ve read.

"Cleveland fans are in a difficult spot, especially for fans who have followed the team throughout the 1980s. Naturally, any fan of the Browns has no problem rooting for any team that plays the hated Steelers, but it may feel a little strange rooting for the team that sent Cleveland to some of its most devastating losses in the 1980s behind QB John Elway. For many, that might not be a problem, and Cleveland’s sports bars are likely to be crowded by fans watching and hoping for a miracle from the Tebow-led Broncos."
"He points out that the message is that people are sinful, they must repent and believe on Christ, and that it will be costly to follow him. While sharing the good news, we must communicate the urgency of their need for Jesus, as well as explaining that all of the sacrifice involved in being a disciple of Christ will be worthwhile. We must base our appeals on scripture, and ultimately leave the results up to God as our efforts are bathed in prayer (126-130)."

"If many of Arizona’s defenders and critics hold one belief in common, it’s that the new “show me your papers” law is sui generis: it’s seen as one angry border state’s response to its outsized share of America’s illegal immigration crisis. But to label this development “Arizona’s folly” trivializes its import and reach. The more you examine the law’s provisions and proponents, the more you realize that it’s the latest and (so far) most vicious battle in a far broader movement that is not just about illegal immigrants — and that is steadily increasing its annexation of one of America’s two major political parties.The rest is as argument-free and as invective-filled as the beginning. Opinionators like Rich don't bother to offer reasons, they simply denounce, the ""point-and-sputter"" method of debate. Which I'm sure goes down well with the average Times reader."

Of course I knew that there were cities in Texas, and skyscrapers, freeways and shopping malls, but I'm a child of the fifties, and was brought up on Dick West and the Lone Ranger. So of course I looked for signs of cowboys. They were easy enough to find. And along with the whites, in cowboy hats or not, there were of course Blacks, Hispanics, Chinese, the whole rainbow of peoples that makes a place vibrant."

"Chapter 6 of Shawn Ritenour’s Foundations of Economics examines what happens when the supply or demand of a good or service in the marketplace changes. Ritenour makes the point that confusion sometimes results from a change in market prices. When the price of, say, coffee rises, this is not necessarily indicative of a rise in demand. Demand may be exactly the same as before, but a reduction of supply may have led to the price increase. The reverse is also true; a price may change even though supply is constant if demand changes."

"Conservatives also love to remind us of the intense scientific debate surrounding these issues, especially global warming. However, regarding global warming, an accurate depiction of the debate would look something like 97 scientists debating 3 scientists (who are often funded by industries who rely on practices detrimental to the environment). Most of the debate involves the quantity of change expected and whether or not man can reverse this trend. Despite which side is more right, almost all research indicates that mankind must pursue a starkly different approach to how we relate with the environment."

I explained to her I was upset that I was not able to solve this on my own, that as a professional and as a mom I felt like a failure. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever heard as a mom. She said even if I was the best race car driver in the world and I had the best car ever built I could not win the race if a tree fell across the track. Someone would have to remove the barrier so my car and I could continue on our journey. It was not my fault that nursing was not going well.

"Such a development would be troubling in any country, but that is particularly true for Mauritania, which suffers from serious deficits in governance and an easy availability of arms. The insecurity is even more pronounced in the north of the country given its proximity to the Western Sahara, a conflict-ridden territory. Cross­border traffic of illicit products with the Western Sahara has been a booming industry, with the Polisario Front, which is fighting for the Western Sahara’s independence from Morocco, dominating the supply side of arms to Mauritania. A 2008 report by the Mauritanian Department of National Security estimates that the number of uncontrolled weapons in Mauritania stands at 70,000. This “has led to a wave of criminality due to the fact that it is easier and easier to procure arms of different types and calibres, including weapons of war,” according to a study by the Small Arms Survey."

"We decided to start getting back as the sun was starting to set, but first we had to deal with a huge people-jam. Whilst we were amongst it all, we thought we would never get out. I was very convinced it was a dead-end as there could be no other reason for all these people also struggling to move in the opposite direction to us. 15 minutes of my life wasted later and we were out. I felt successful. On the way back to the bikes I saw a scout stall selling t-shirts which I regret not buying. They said “I crown(in picture form) NL”. I don’t have a t-shirt to signify my stay in the Netherlands and this one seemed very nice in comparison to the ones we would see the next day in Amsterdam. I also want this one in town that says “I rain cloud (in picture form) NL”. However they only stock this in XL and man size. The burden of being a women."

He is now a coveted ballet dancer in the States and yet he has kept close ties with his roots back in Cambodia and works bringing dance and, thereby, a better life to the children there. This is an amazing story. The film is called Dancing Across Borders, and I urge you to go read about the film and the story behind it here. And in the meantime, check this out:"

And that his planned confession lists the offended parties in the right order — “I sinned against heaven and against you.” But he has not yet totally surrendered: the son wants to be a hired servant; to do his father the justice of making restitution. Now restitution is a good thing as far as it goes, but the son’s plan overlooks that he cannot put a price tag on his father’s agony. To that extent he still doesn’t see the full gravity of his offense; he knows he has wronged his father, but he still thinks himself competent to judge his wrong and his father’s loss, and to sentence himself to repayment of squandered property. In short, he’s still attached to some idea of right, and the desire to captain his own ship. With these things in mind he goes home."

"By around Noon or so we were all talking/hanging out, when I noticed, “Mike”. I had seen him earlier in his wheelchair but had been praying for someone else. I’m always a little reserved/hesitant to pray for people in wheelchairs. My faith typically shrinks by the reality of “WHEELCHAIR” rather than the reality of “GOD”. Forgive us, Abba. I grabbed Sammy and we went over to Mike and asked what had happened. He shared the story of his return to the Bronx last December from a vacation out west. While in the cab ride back from the airport a large delivery truck had smashed into the cab. Both his legs were crushed from the knees down. The doctor did not anticipate salvaging his legs. Surgery was successful (praise God!) although he had not been able to use his legs at all since. They had just checked his legs two weeks prior and told him that his legs were in no condition to carry his body. Over the past year both legs had felt completely numb with no feeling whatsoever other than pain. I thanked him for sharing his story and asked if we could pray over his legs. He agreed (BTW – I’ve found MOST people will let you pray over them especially when you approach them in genuine compassion and ask them about their condition/problem/etc.) We began praying a short prayer commanding his legs to be made whole. Pain leave, muscles, bones, tendons be strengthened. Legs work and operate the way you were made to! Then I asked Mike what he was feeling. He said, “You know, it’s funny. It’s almost like someone shot electricity down my knee caps into my legs.” I asked if he normally felt these “shocks”. He responded that he had never in his life felt anything like them. Ha! It’s on! The first sign of an instant healing miracle is often something happening in a person’s body that is completely out of the ordinary (such as heat, cooling, electricity, buzzing). It’s not always the case that they feel something, but often they do. Either way, if you have a heart to see people healed, don’t let feelings dictate what you believe about God’s character and heart for others. Just because we don’t “feel” anything, doesn’t mean God isn’t actively at work."

"Some may object to me calling hold up men ""the enemy"". You can call them whatever you like. I can assure you however they are as deadly an enemy as you will find anywhere but the battlefield. Even many soldiers probably lack the viciousness and utter disregard for life most hold up men possess."
"You asked a question and the immediate reaction was, no you can't, why do you think about something like that, it is a waste of time or you might even get an immediate thrashing. Knowledge, I learned was not universal, it was linked and channeled to a certain mindset. You dare to think out of that little square and you'll be pulled in the mouth."

"Patsy Cline (September 8, 1932 – March 5, 1963), born Virginia Patterson Hensley, was an American country music singer who enjoyed pop music crossover success during the era of the Nashville sound in the early 1960s. Since her death at age 30 in a 1963 private airplane crash at the height of her career, she has been considered one of the most influential, successful and acclaimed female vocalists of the 20th century."
"With the “Pirate of the Year” awards around the corner, Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) and his crew of scallywags take to the high seas to find a bounty worthy of entering the awards. Instead they find a young Charles Darwin (David Tennant), who informs them that their beloved parrot is in fact a rare dodo, a discovery priceless in the scientific world."
"The T 20 “Komsomolets” tractor was designed to tow light artillery pieces such as this 45mm anti-tank gun and the 120mm heavy mortar. It could tow the weapons themselves plus a small quantity of ammunition (in a limber that is unfortunately not supplied with the Bolt Action model) and up to six crewmen. The fully armored forward compartment provided space for the driver and vehicle commander and had a ball-mounted DT machinegun. The rear compartment held the gun crews, seated back-to-back in outward-facing bench seats."
"I was 20. I'd not long split up with someone and I was feeling fairly sorry for myself, unattractive, unloved, slightly unhinged."
"Being across the pond this is all sort of a mute point now, there are no Targets here. I got to see what friends bought at the Jason Wu collab. and while everything was very nice I wasn’t too jealous as the same high-necked sun dresses and structured hand-bags are for sale at Primark. Everything is first lady suitable and Michelle Obama has set the new standard for work appropriate chic wearing a lot of Jason Wu’s creations. His mix of blues and whites is amazing as always and the trench coats are gorgeous (although I do have a very similar one from Brooklyn industries). Then I look at his Spring 2012 line and it’s just so amazing I can’t even speak. There are 100 ways to incorporate that kind of grace and shine into the mainstream collection so why is Target styling us down?"
"So our 52 Pages is almost at an end, and many people have asked me if I am doing a prompt challenge next year...well I am...sort of. I will try and explain what I am going to do, and then if you would like to join in that would be wonderful."
"As a conclusion, creationism is bad....because it reverts you to an amoeba like stage, and that would be such a pity, since you've come a long way. How can they still think that the Earth was created 6000 years ago? What about all those then thousand - million year old fossils? Creationists, what is your final argument?"
"After that, everything was a piece of cake. Every time I popped over to see how she was doing, I'd see a new kitten. I seriously started to worry about finding homes for all of them, but I decided I'd keep one. Two others found a home as soon as I published the picture above on Facebook, so I only need to find a home for one... AND it was only hours after they were born. I'M SO HAPPY!!!"
And that's it for the first 40 mins of a 3.40 hr session. Yep. That's right. I still have /3 hours/ to go through. These are the things keeping me up at night.

Perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier.

"As I said, I know it’s petty, but I just thought I might’ve earned an official goodbye from these people by this point. If someone who was here for less than a year gets her parting acknowledged, I would think I’d get a bit of the same."

"But stress is a key spice of human life. Like salt, it is essential to our physiology. Just the right sodium concentration in our circulation supports health. Too much can harm our tissues and organs, including our brains."
What a letdown. This complex flaunts terraces and an indoor swimming pool and a lobby fountain and a sauna. Very class. But here Vacuum Man’s pad sits practically empty. No digital TV or leather couches or wardrobe or anything. One mattress in the bedroom. A few putrefying plastic sacks in the fridge. Rows and rows of pills and stomach tabs in the bathroom. Probably Vacuum Man is too busy being a hog to think of home furnishings. Me and Jae watched him waddle to ATMs and conjure up wads from his fanny pack scarfing his way across town. A whole week we’ve been watching him.
"Local film screening venues have been capitalizing on the silent film/Oscar resonances all Winter, and the reverberations continue throughout March and into the coming months as well. The Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum includes Méliès films in three of its five Saturday night screening programs this month, including a hand-colored print of his Palace of the Arabian Nights March 31st. The Balboa Theatre also grabs a hold of Hugo this Sunday when it celebrates its 86th birthday. The tradition of showing a silent film during their annual bash continues, this year with a 35mm print of Harold Lloyd in Safety Last, the film from which comes the iconic image of a bespectacled wall-crawler hanging off a giant department store clock. Hugo presents this image prominently as well, when its main characters attend a film screening (although in the original book they attend the Rene Clair film Le Million.) Past Balboa birthday parties (I've attended three over the years) have been some of the best value-for-ticket-dollar experiences I've had on Frisco Bay. Not only is there a feature film with live musical accompaniment, but also other live entertainment, cake, door prizes and the opportunity for trivia prizes as well. Last year I made quite a haul, and would've even if I hadn't known my Charlie Chaplin trivia."
"Like most gardeners, I have a surplus of seed from years past. So I went easy in my ordering this time around. I only purchased from one company, my favorite, Baker Creek, and chose a small handful of things I have been eager to try. Here's this year's highlights."
"I framed it behind an old, weathered door frame with glass insets that I found at a salvage store. I don’t know how the glass survived but it did. It is a heavy piece but it hangs prominently on a wall in my apartment."

"To do this, you'll need just a few extra supplies In addition to ones listed above. You’ll need an extra notepad and rubber stamp for the hidden letterbox, as well as a small box to hide them in. Use the smallest possible container the stamp will fit in so it’s easier to hide. Finally, enclose everything in a zipper bag to waterproof it."

I wondered why he suffered in silence and why I never stood up against the injustice and reported the domestic violence that rocked their home daily.
"There are many examples of this contemporary mindset, but one especially obvious one can be found in the financial black hole of our modern education institutions. In these cauldrons of loveless envy, God and objective truth have been expelled while simultaneously attempting to hold fast to ethics. This of course is Folly. Lewis has another famous and astute point regarding this:"

"These two procedures may be overly cautious — done for all to protect the very, very few — but neither have been proven dangerous. An argument could be made for rolling with hospital policy, if only to keep your blood pressure down at a time when you’ll be dealing with enough stress. If you want to avoid routine post-natal medication, first talk to your obstetrician or midwife well before the birth (before thirty-five weeks) about whether you have a choice in the matter, and if so, what he or she recommends for you. If you feel really strongly about this issue, you could consider a home birth where you’d have more say in the matter. Otherwise, you can find safety (or solace?) in numbers: the overwhelming majority of babies are given both treatments, and are apparently none the worse for it."
"Barisan Nasional grassroots leaders, increasingly disconcerted by the reach of Radio Free Sarawak (RFS) in the interior of Sarawak, are claiming that the news aired by the Internet broadcasting network is “poisoning” the “mentality” of the native Dayaks."

"Betty starting school was by far the most emotional thing to happen in 2011. Where she has embraced it wholeheartedly, I still haven't quite come to terms with the fact my first-born isn't at home with me and making glittery play dough, day in and day out. And her new way of talking doesn't sit pretty with me either, you know, where every sentence goes up at the end. I don't like the whole having to wear black shoes thing either."
I love the idea behind the Big Brain Club! Tell us about it and why programs like this are so important to students.
"Ah yes, anyways… I think we all are familiar with the infamous “ScyFy B-Movie” (ScyFy being Klingon for “intentionally stupid”, one assume). I certainly am. With random monsters, awful acting, a lot of boobs, horrid writing, a lot of boobs, gore, boobs, and boobs, there are rather entertaining affairs. Certainly comedic. However, I find the Internet is gradually circumventing television in my life, due to the damn intercommies who need to learn their fucking place, thus preventing me from indulging in such guilty pleasures."

"Using a A6 card blank as a base, I used the paper I had dotted with Mica Powder as the background and the images really 'Popped' off the page. The fence is mounted using foam pads so you get the feeling that it is closer to you."
My question then is this:

"News about the 1,000 missing Chinese missiles and a fourth Israeli German made dolphin sub, this one carrying an antiquated hydrogen bomb, interfered with by Semjase and her command ship lifting the subs out of water (as well as the Chinese subs that were to attack the west coast of the USA three weeks ago) is indeed going on. As I have said many times, our friendly neighborhood tree-hugging hippy aliens will indeed intervene when nukes come into play, because the repercussions are felt throughout the galaxy and inner earth and in 5-11D.,"

"Good luck with your life Sgt Stein, I appreciate you standing by you guns and I'm sorry I didn't pull you aside and tell you, ""dude, if you post that, the brass is going to hammer you"". Which I have been known to do to my blogger buddies when I see someone stepping over that line. But I can't follow everything that goes on with the military in cyber space, I do have a life."
Until that day I am comforted by a lifetime of memories of a loving earthly father.
"Then one of my loyal blog readers contacted me. She said she had a message for me and would like to do a tarot reading. I accepted and she informed me that I was on the right path and my next step was to begin a resource website for women. I thought it was foolish. I mean, how could I help women when I was so down and out myself? But I love writing and research and building websites so I decided that it wouldn’t hurt to try.I came up with the name My Savvy Sisters because I wanted to reach a caliber of women who were strategic in their life goals and hell bent on achieving their dreams. I wanted to teach women how to survive anything and I wanted to show them how to overcome their personal obstacles. In essence, I wanted to give the very assistance that I needed so much at the time. These ladies would become My Sisters and after much growing together, My Savvy Sisters, because we will be indestructible and wise enough to turn any situation into a benefit for us."

"So here we are at the end of the A to Z challenge. It wasn’t nearly as hard as I thought it might be, even with a trip to Montana thrown into the mix. I managed to post on time — well, except for yesterday. And a couple of glitches with the scheduing. And tongiht, when I’m barely going to make it by midnight. But mostly it went smoothly and I found myself with more to say than I thought I would. More interesting stuff, too, even for me."
"It’s good that their coach doesn’t see what I see when I watch the girls try to kick… or dribble… or shoot. I see areas that I would love to correct and it takes every bone in my body not to point out when they do it “wrong”. He is working to learn names, understand the drill description in the association practice plan, and then it looks like herding cats to run them through the important games of tag, or red light/ green light. He lets them choose games and in doing so…they are a part of the process."

"‘Fusion Junction’ is an interesting art book dedicated to a niche genre - game and comic book character design. Since the steep rise in graphic capabilities in games there has also been a corresponding rise in expectation of detail and quality in character design. Comic book art has also metamorphosed since the ‘golden’ and ‘silver’ age of the 1950′s. Comics now offer a wide and often radical difference in art styles, often reflecting the mood of the story lines. ‘Fusion Junction’ celebrates the achievements of these artists, who are sometimes overlooked due to the commercial aspect of their art."
"Also, bonus, as of today I have officially lost 12 pounds since I was last weighed the morning of my surgery. Granted, a clear liquid diet for 5 days followed by being too nauseous and weak to eat much of anything is probably not the best diet plan, but that is what happened and I plan to not let my suffering go to waste and remain on this weight loss trajectory, only maybe at a slightly more realistic pace."
The timing of Mr Breitbart’s death and the existence of the video caused dozens of conspiracy theorists to claim that President Obama was somehow linked to his death.
"The last two weeks were wonderful but crazy. I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I sat down for a bit this morning as I pondered...things. I couldn't decide if I wanted to reflect on the Christmas season or set goals for the new year. So, I did neither. Yet."
I didn't want my drink before and I certainly didn't want it now. I felt an arm go around my neck and I cringed but tried to hide it.
"Nehemiah was modeling to each of us a spiritual principle regarding sin. Whenever we sin, we give God permission to unleash the enemy into our souls to deal with that sin. Nehemiah understood this principle and warned the people of what this action would encourage from God. The people repented and returned the money gained through usury."
"Somewhere along the way I got my funny bone but I still hate it when people tell me jokes. I feel obligated to laugh and 9/10 times I don't think the joke is funny(I get the joke I just don't like the joke). The only jokes I think are hilarious are the ones my kids told me when they were really little and we were in the car on a long road trip. They went something like: knock, knock! (who's there) car! (car who?) car butt that was blue with treetops! har,har,har! and...and...snot with rainbow boogers and..and... (those random bits of what my little ones thought were so hilarious I TOO thought were hilarious!) so I am a joke snob I suppose but only 5yr and under jokes do I find funny!"
"So this week we have been helping out front of house with the local production of Guys and Dolls, which is fab! We are normally in these shows but we had a break this year. However, show week has been just as busy for us with that and other things. And when we haven't been there, we have been watching other shows!"

"I started saving £5 a month many years ago when I earned £80 per week, my rent was £40 of that. It was back breaking work and very hard to put that £5 aside, but I did it. The years went by and I increased the amounts as I could, I couldn’t yet afford a pension yet so at least I thought I should increase the savings slowly."
"But that doesn't stop me from yearning for their return. You see, I may be from Detroit but my paternal grandmother was raised in Brooklyn. I vaguely remember the stories she would tell me as a very young boy. They may not have been on top during her time in this borough. (Ironically, she beat the team in moving to la-la land by a decade.) I do remember the passion she had in describing the team."

"Learning to label oneself an “Artist” seems like a rite of passage in the process of artistic formation. What I have come to realize is that it feels safer to downplay anything about myself that another may have the power to reject or ridicule. If I call myself a Songwriter and proclaim myself as such to others, someone else may very well listen to my music and say, “I don’t like it. She’s not very good. She is no songwriter.” Another person certainly has the ability to say that of me, but that ability does not make my artistic endeavors illegitimate. We have all been made to function in unique and specific ways that are not dependent on the approving response of others. Nonetheless, the response of others is a key part of artistic formation since we learn and grow as we share our work with one another in a relational context while experiencing mixtures of rejection and affirmation. In extending ourselves to one another, we risk artistically and relationally."

"And most of all, I know God is with us. He provided everything. Big deals from ty'd old job. My mom paying for the rental truck. A place to live with half off the deposit. A view of the bay and even stairs leading up to our house (something silly that I wanted). I feel peaceful. I enjoy my job. Ty starts at Honda on Monday."
"A couple of months ago I was told to watch Food Inc. I was warned that it would have an effect on me. Nah, not me. I am strong-willed and not easily influenced. Boy was I WRONG! I am convinced that the a lot of health problems humans suffer are a direct result of diet you consume. Another one to watch is forks over knives. It really opens your eyes to how and where our food originates. Chickens, cows, and pigs are treated and fed horribly. Caged without room to sit, stacked on each other, covered in their own waste and fed antibiotics and even fed other animals. I am not saying to give up meat, but be conscious of where your food source is coming from. Support free range and organic. Free range is when the animals are allowed to roam free, without cages. Organic is no pesticides, no growth hormones, no chemicals. Yes shopping and buying these products can be more pricey, but in the end you may be saving yourself from hefty medical bills later. After all, you only get one body. You should think of it as a high class, high efficiency automobile. Those vehicles take high grade for a reason. You should only service and fill up your body with high grade product."

My husband is an entrepreneur and has started many businesses, so I think I can lay a lot of ‘blame’ on him.

I had to get out of work at lunchtime today to go and sign the lease for my new place with BFF and left a little late because I got caught up. So as I go to exit out of the basement car park there’s people everywhere. Just as I’m about to get a break in the traffic this stupid bitch goes to walk in front of my car. Are you fucking kidding me? I’m going to drive bitch and if that means I’m going to mow you down and leave you for dead then I’m going to fucking do it.

"We have been here for each other through pretty much everything; we make each other better day by day. Iron sharpens iron, you know. She has always been here for me, regardless of how much I have ever hurt her, and I am trying to make that up to her. Last spring, I pretty much gave up on everything and everyone. I focused so much on school and work only, that I lost track of who I was, and where I wanted to be. I threw everything on the ground and turned and walked away. When I opened my eyes to my stubborn pride, she was one of a very small group of people still there when I turned back to survey the damage I had done. We had a huge heart to heart; we both cried. She tried to apologize because she has a sweet heart like that. I really hope that never changes."
"The Annaberg Sugar Mill Plantation Ruins comprise the Annaberg Historic District in the Virgin Islands National Park. Sugar plantations were abundant in this region throughout the 19th century. Though originally grown in India, Columbus brought sugar to the Caribbean, where it thrived. You’ve heard “Cotton was King” in reference to the US South. Well, here “Sugar was King.” In 1758, a Dutch immigrant, Salomon Zeeger, purchased the property and named it Annaberg in honor of his wife Anna. Though its namesake, the Zeegers did not construct the mill, which dates to ca. 1800. An Irish merchant,James Murphy, purchased many adjacent properties, including Annaberg, to create his sugar estate. Sugar product continued on the plantation long after his death in 1808."
"I offer one final, fresh example of odd behaviour by the Telegraph. Over the last 36 hours, I have noticed this: every time Prince Andrew has been described as ‘worried’ about his role as a trade envoy – or Cameron has been described as being told to ‘get a grip’ about the issue – the online edition has not allowed comments. The more shrill the paper becomes about it, the more suspicious I become of Gallagher’s compulsive desire to bury the Prince’s reputation."
"The Incarnation is a difficult doctrine to come to grips with. By the incarnation we’re referring to the event of God becoming a man in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. Part of the reason for this difficulty is because there is a whole bunch of technical terminology that is flung around that needs to be understood. And a lot of these technical terms refer to specific ways of understanding the incarnation that, for one reason or another, don’t express the way the Bible speaks about the person of Jesus."

"If you do it first, they can’t do it to you: they can’t tell you anything you don’t already know, or hurt you any more than you have already hurt yourself. If you do it, you can do it right: you can make a list longer than they would ever have thought of, so there is no possible way they can come up with something new, some unguarded fleshy spot into which they can slip the knife. If you do it yourself, everything is scar tissue, tough as rope you have already hung yourself with in every possible way."

"Sometimes I wish I was a dancer. When my senses catch music, there is a sensational exhilaration that overtakes me, leaves me overwhelmed. I can feel my every muscle ache, yearning to break into a rigorous dance sequence. Every beats gets attention, every rhythm is felt through and through. Every word of every song is paid heed to. Music makes me lose control, true. Dancing makes me completely frenzy. Even if Im engulfed with work or exhausted, the ripples in music hits me like a disease. It starts from my toes, runs up to my knees, settles on the hips and sends signals to the arms and before you know it, I’ve caught it. I am so passionate about it, shame; I could never exploit it completely. Maybe someday I would."

However, the day was brightened up by an early start with blue skies and our lovely girl friend Olivia, one of our daughter’s best friends, has come to stay at our house for a sleep over, something we have owed her for a long while, it is her first ever sleepover at our house, although she has visited many a time she has never slept."

"A rollicking good time appeared to be had by all (at least from where I was sitting), plenty of money was raised for the SOS Helpline and no-one got hurt (except, perhaps, for the collective dignity and pride of the French nation, so insistent were the parries and thrusts from those of us who make a buck poking fun at or otherwise highlighting the apparent absurdity of some of their quirkier habits)."

At least then I’m not panicking about not being able to fall asleep…” etc. Classic application of the adage, “Begin where you are.” Sitting at my kitchen table, unsold dozens of eggs from today’s market all around me, my stomach growls from too much adrenaline and too little food.

"Analysis: By admitting in open court that he lied at least twice, and that he took $10,000 in silver from Edgar Steele, and that he's contemplating writing a book and appearing on the Oprah show, Larry Fairfax has established himself as an inherently dishonest opportunist who cannot be trusted and who's clearly trying to ""sing for his supper"", so to speak. Any intelligent, fair-minded juror should conclude that Larry Fairfax's testimony actually introduces MORE DOUBT into the Federal story about Edgar Steele, decreasing the chances of his conviction. However, all members of the jury are women, except for one, so ultimately Edgar Steele's fate may lie in the hands of Cyndi Steele. Her testimony will either convict or acquit her husband."

"2010 was something of a high water mark for me: it was as if a number of energies simultaneously caught fire and delivered a concentrated year of brilliant, memorable theatre. Perhaps inevitably, 2011 has had a feeling of being on the shoulder of a peak, perhaps reinforced by a sense that main stage theatre here is in significant transition. Certainly it's been hard to look towards Sydney and not feel that Sydney main stage theatre has it all over us."

Bring to boil with just about enough water to cover the wedges. Leave the skin on as it will be strained after anyway and the colour is so beautiful. Cook until soft and strain through a cheese cloth. The juice was enough for one jar of jelly. Even Martha Stewart likes crab apple jelly and she famously whipped up one during her time in jail with crab apples picked from trees on the prison camp grounds. Well, you just can take Martha out of the kitchen..."

"The representational theory of mind is deeply entrenched and some disambiguation is necessary to avoid outlandish interpretations of externalism and its claims. In this book I am examining the meanings of psychological predicates; in this chapter, intentional predicates. So for me the “meaning” in question is the meaning of words like “believes,” “desires,” “hopes,” “fears” and so on, in the sense of ontological reference: what ontological commitments do we make when we use these words? When Putnam says that “meaning isn’t in the head,” he isn’t talking about the meaning of the word “belief” (my topic), he’s talking about meaning in the sense that the alleged proposition that is the alleged object of the attitude is supposed to be about something: the proposition is the thing that is about something, on the representational realist view, and the proposition is represented “in the head.”"

Either the correction since the high in late-February has run its course and it is about to run again. Or, if it falls below $100 it wouldn’t be hard to see it coming down to $90.00-$97.00. If the equity market is still in correction mode towards 1300-1340 the positive correlation with oil since March 2009 would suggest that oil is headed lower. As I mentioned above, let’s see which scenario pans out. We should have a pretty good idea by the end of the week."

"As the twentieth century progressed, our industry (along with many others) began to consolidate. Smaller presses were bought by larger presses – grandparents of the major international conglomerates we are now familiar with, and instead of multiple offices over shops, we began to see the establishment of warehouses – and the beginning of a distancing between customer and publisher – as independent bookselling took off. (Bookshops had previously existed in the university cities – but gradually they were established in most sizeable market towns). These bookshops were supplied by the publishers’ central warehouse, while smaller publishers continued to supply direct."
"Have any of you heard of what’s called extreme running? It seems that runners aren’t satisfied with pushing their bodies to their limits on streets, in parks, or at the local high school track.

The third book in the Frederica Potter quadrilogy has our intrepid heroine forging a life for herself in the intellectual circles of 1960s London.

You don’t need to read the other books in the quadrilogy to understand this book. The Frederica Potter quadrilogy is a rarity in literature, with its headstrong, generally unsympathetic heroine who makes some horrible choices but never compromises her intellect."

"The beginning montage introducing the cast and narration feels a little bit rehearsed, but it does hold your attention as the viewer. The first bedroom scene with Patricia and the guy as well as the bedroom scene between Scolly Cheruto and Godfrey Odhiambo lacks the believability that you would expect. I mean for a show described as the Kenyan version of Sex and The City we expect a little bit of spice. The problem with being a singer and crossing over to acting is that you are judged more harshly and Wendy Kimani will have to go through this before she can be accepted as an actress. The scene that stands out is the scene with Marriane Nungo and Patricia, it has a naturalness about it with Marriane delivering a stellar performance."

"Ahh - the true price of diversity! The UK is facing a huge crime wave and the offenders are being outed as 'foreigners'. This article goes to great lengths to omit the race/country of origin of the perpetrators - although it does hint at the influx of people from former Easter Bloc countries - yet says nothing about the Pakistanis and other third worlders (miles too un-PC you see). The latest figure of 91 000 foreign criminals is up from 52 000 in 2008. So, in two years, the figure has nearly doubled - and this figure may be twice as high as over half the police forces didn't release their figures. What would be a sensible response to this issue, you'd ask? Cut the number of 'foreigners' coming into the country? No way Jose! Cut the number of policemen!! Yes, that's right - allow all the riff-raff in to commit serious crimes, leach off the welfare and then encourage more bad behaviour by cutting down on the police force! Gotta love this new PC world we live in. Don't cut down on foreign aid, UN and climate change financial support - rather cut down on internal policing. Me thinks that a trip to the UK has just come off my list of potential holiday destinations - I'd rather go to the Australian Outback and say hi to some feral camels and hop with the kangaroos - seems I may be safer...."

"She calls, says she has to give me a whole bag of IV fluid first so baby and mine heart rate doesn't go down. That takes 30 minuets. Than takes over another 30 minuets for the anesthesiologist to get there. Once she is in there the contractions are so so intense. My whole body is shaking, I'm literally convulsing and can't help it. I ask Davey for a barf bag. I didn't throw up but really felt like I was going to. Contractions are about every 30-45 seconds apart. I feel a lot more pressure with each one, not quit yet like I was ready to push, but just feel more pressure, like the baby is moving down."

"For the most part, I feel that parenting is a two-person job. I understand there are many single mothers and fathers out there doing a phenomenal job and I would never discredit their commitments to parenting — I just feel (and have interpreted such sentiments from the sentiments of single parents) that single parents are often times playing a dual role in parenting, understanding that it is a dual role. I genuinely believe a boy without a father will seek out a male role model despite having a loving, strong mother. Perhaps that means keeping him active in sports, under coaching, but I believe that. I also believe that there is no greater love, and should be no greater love than a mothers love for her child — carrying and delivering a life that has only known the sound of your voice and heart beat, you are the origin of our absolute existence. Cherish that despite however ungrateful we may be at times. I promise you, we all come to appreciate it one day. Eventually. Hopefully. (If you haven’t you better!)"

Drinking alcohol was the only thing that helped calm the tremors. Ironically, the doctors have noted this as well. My husband went to a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders looking for some hope. The doctor said “There’s not a lot out there that will help your arm. Alcohol will but you run the risk of becoming an alcoholic.”"

"Heat olive oil over medium heat until it thins and shimmers (about 6 seconds). Lower each blossom flat into the hot oil, taking care not to crowd them in skillet. Each subsequent blossom will lower the temperature of the oil, so care must be taken to adjust heat level. It must maintain an even, but not violent sizzle. Do not overly heat the oil to speed the process. Burning the blossoms can occur very quickly. Fry on each side for about 5 minutes until golden brown, using long metal tongs to turn them.

"One of the powerful things about article marketing, especially if you are building a list, is that subscribers who come to you after reading one of your articles tend to buy more than subscribers who come to you from many other traffic sources. Generally, when someone subscribes to your list after reading one or several of your articles, they already are beginning to trust you, and might buy from you sooner than someone who needs to read several emails from you and perhaps communicate online before they will purchase. Article writing simply provides a unique opportunity for you too attract subscribers to your list who have a prequalified interest and trust in you."

"I’m sorry to say that my second encounter with Ms. Morton left me more than a little disappointed. In fact, though The Distant Hours seemed like it would have many of the same characteristics as Morton’s earlier work, they were almost entirely absent from this book. The Distant Hours felt under-crafted and under-thought, with paper-thin characters and a heavy-handed delivery. It’s all the more surprising because I described The Forgotten Garden as finely crafted, with a light touch of symbolism. The Distant Hours is the opposite. Edie is a clunky narrator with no apparent personality and her voice often drew me out of the narrative with references to “what she’d learn later” or things she “wished she could have known then.” She has no personality of her own and her mother’s connection to the castle is never properly exploited."

"I've been having all these signs that my body is working at getting him out of there (WARNING TMI): losing my mucus plug, menstrual style cramping, dried blood in my ever increasing amount of discharge, i haven't had a solid bowel movement in weeks, the kid has dropped...a LOT. But my cervix is apparently still behind my son's head, it's not really effaced at all and it's only dilated to about 1.5 cm. I feel like a failure that my body seems to be working so hard and NOTHING, almost nothing is happening. It's not just that I'm jealous that they all have their babies right now (obviously that's part of it), but their bodies did things right and mine seems like it doesn't know what to do and I'm left mad and frustrated...and hugely, uncomfortably pregnant without any sign of relief. I know...I won't be pregnant forever, but I had this idea that I was going to be able to do this thing naturally. That I wouldn't have to force my body to get this kid out, that it was going to be wonderful, beautiful experience. Now it's probably going to end up with me being induced with either my kid being so drugged upon his arrival or me being drugged from a c-section that I won't be able to appreciate it like I expected to. And of course, having to wait to do any of this for another 2 wks because my OB/GYN clinic won't induce me until 41 wks."

"I collected knowledge very slowly. Fortunately (and I suppose inevitably) as I continued my relationship with boats information came in as relentlessly as the tide. So as a result my pool of knowledge very gradually became deeper. Unfortunately, also in keeping with my metaphor of the tide, my knowledge seemed to go out too. Knowledge I was so happy to finally possess would recede and be gone several hours later. I am not altogether certain this phenomenon was due to natural causes or if it was exacerbated by frequent infusions of Myers’ Rum and light beer but I guess those are a couple of the reasons it has taken such a long time to assemble the permanent stockpile of knowledge I now supposedly posses. Of course now I am so old I have difficulty remembering the knowledge anyway."

Today you do a volcada and a colgada and it is the same because they are there, commercially speaking, in the same package. Then, between doing a sandwichito or a volcada, people do a volcada, because it's more eye-catching. In tango people are self-centered; there is much individuality. They are not going to make a sandwichito to enjoy that moment, but whatever shows them more and better. In the musical field Astor Piazzolla broke with everything but you listen to it and it is tango. And today in the dance many think that they are Piazzolla and they aren't. I see men and women that only worry about how they are seen from the outside. It is a pretty complicated situation because it has to do with a very porteño personality and identity."

"Enough preaching about CrossFit....I shared this because while working out I have also started to adopt the eating habits that are prevalent among CrossFitters...which is a combination of the 'paleo diet' (basically lots of fruit and veggies, gluten free and good proteins) and a zone diet (again, lost of fruits and veggies, limited grains, if any, and quality lean protein). Being food-obsessed this was a bit tough for me at first, I have no gluten sensitivity and frankly love to try new things so the thought of limiting myself to these confines really bothered me at first. Slowly though I have adapted, partly because our CrossFit gym (much love to Milestone Crossfit!!) set up a 6-week challenge which I eagerly joined and partly because I have seen what the combo of this diet and CrossFit does for people. In four weeks my 'cravings' for grains and super-sweet candy, etc. have dwindled (not going to lie here, I would still kill for hot-buttered fresh baked french bread!) and I feel great. So again, why am I sharing all this? Because it will color a lot of what I will be posting in the near term, most of my coming posts will be recipes that have been made since the beginning of my 6-week challenge and will be reflective of ingredients that are 'zone-paleo' friendly. So be wary those of you who aren't so excited about 'healthy' food, these things will all be slightly better for you than most that I have posted in the past but none of them will taste like 'health' food, I refuse to give up good food for just healthy food."

"This is a typical example of relatively accurate information delivered with an “attitude” to imply a coming catastrophe. Look at the temperature chart above. The global temps did indeed rise several tenths of a degree before 1940 which shows why measurement over a century would show a sea level rise. Then for 35 years the Globe cooled during the massive CO2 output of the post war industrial boom. Then global temps rose quickly from 1976 to 1998 which would result in a rapid warming and expansion of the ocean just NASA says which makes sense given the date of their data set, but since most of this happened before the post war industrial boom how is this mans fault?"

"Oh, lordy, lots at different times! Mac Wellman’s Crowbar by En Garde Arts in 1990 is as good as any. I’d been in NYC three whole days when my friend Dan called and asked if I wanted to be in the ensemble of a play he was stage managing. Looking back, I can’t believe I hesitated, even if only briefly. The production was a whole new world. I’d never heard of site-specific theater before, I’d never read or seen anything like Mac’s work, I’d never imagined exploring every nook and cranny of a former Broadway theater (the Victory, pre-New Victory). The production became a huge hit, with celebrities in the audience every night. I met wonderful folks, like Richard Caliban, Annie Hamburger, Jan Leslie Harding, Juliana Francis, Michael John Garces, Lou Moreno, Richard Sheinmel and Anita Durst. I got my Equity card. And it entirely changed the kind of work I wanted to do."

"Once I initially freaked out and calmed down. I decided to put sticky notes on my students desk so they could track their learning using their scales each time the learning goal was said and they showed their understanding on their learning scale. It sounds like a lot to do but my kids had already been showing me their understanding by using their fingers 4-I can teach a friend 3-I understand 2-I understand most of it but need more help and 1-I'm trying but I don't understand yet. So all they had to do was write this down on the sticky note during the beginning, middle, and end of the lesson. It worked out well (thank goodness, I must have a teacher guardian angel) and the lesson ran smoothly. My students enjoyed working together in cooperative groups and making the foldable. My students behaved and did a wonderful job with the lesson. My principal loved how I had differentiate activities for all types of learners. Yeah, go me! She gave me a high five on the way out and said great job. Seconds later I got an e-mail already from iObservation telling me what I got on my observation which was applying."

"The more and more that I think about it, this idea of sin all boils down to selfishness. There isn’t a single sin in my life (and I would argue anyone’s life) that can’t be summed up by my selfishness. Selfishness looks out for one thing and one thing only: my own interest. Selfishness makes a person ugly and unappealing inside and out. Selfishness leaves a person empty, alone and hopeless, yet in the midst of it, selfishness promises instant gratification previously unknown."

I could take up to 10 CD's, so I picked out some that I thought I might be familiar with."

The club car was right behind us and we could hear the merry voices of the young vacationers. I pulled out my travel Bible. I had promised my aunt I would give her some guidance as to how to navigate the sometimes daunting book before we got to Taize. Although she’d been baptized and confirmed, run a pre-school program at an Episcopal Church, and maintained a childlike faith her whole life, she had never read The Bible or done any sort of Bible study.

"The physical side of a relationship includes attraction and sexual satisfaction. This category is self explanatory. Are you attracted to your partner? Does your partner satisfy you in the bedroom? Overall, this tends to be the least important category in a relationship. Some people tend to over look this category if the other two categories are being fulfilled. It really all depends on the person, the goal is to find out what your needs are. If you have to be attracted or sex is important to you, this category will probably be at the top of your list. But be careful, many people fall in love with the physical and realize, when it’s too late, that the other two sides of the relationship aren’t being met. The physical side of the relationship tends to be the “trouble seeker” in relationships for that reason. Over the years, I’ve come to realize that people tend to confuse love and lust. So just make sure you aren’t in lust with your partner but in love with them."
"For starters, let’s dispel this nonsense that states that zombies, in their science fiction capacity, are ‘the living dead’. No, they aren’t. They aren’t dead at all–they’re alive. They are people with a disease that modifies their behavior, and that’s it. They can’t be dead because dead things don’t (and can’t) move around. No disease imparts motility on inanimate matter. No disease can. The disease’s function is to attack the brain, primarily, for the purpose of altering behavior in a specific way (see part 2). Viruses don’t have muscles to move things, even collectively, and even if they did there is very little likelihood they could coordinate together on such a massive scale as to operate a human body in even a rudimentary fashion. Hell, they don’t have *eyes*. Good luck spreading a zombie plague without eyes, super-virus. Sorry, but zombies are living people."

"A part of me died along with Jill - the part that never knew about suffering and death; the part that believed in miracles; the part that believed things happened for a reason. It's a loss of innocence, I guess, and it's something I'll never get back. I can't ""unsee"" the things I saw, or ""unlearn"" the things I learned, so I've had to find new ways of looking at things. I'm finding my way, but I'll never be the same. There will always be a hole in my life that can never be filled, a best friend lost forever. A lifelong friendship like we had is something that few people ever experience, and although I will live the rest of my life without her, I will treasure every single moment that we shared while she was here. And as hard as it was for me to watch her suffer like that, I'm glad I was there, and I hope that in some small way my being there helped make it a little less horrible and painful for her. I'll never forget the way Jill died, but neither will I forget the way she lived. Her life was tragically short, but she got more joy out of her brief time here than most people ever do. Jill lived every day of her life as a shining example of how to be at peace with the world and everything in it. She was the most positive and happy and optimistic person I've ever known, and you can't be around someone like that without learning from them. She made a difference in the lives of everyone who knew her, and every single life she touched has been forever changed. I truly believe she was an angel who came into my life for a reason. I just wish I could find a reason for why she was taken away so soon. She was too young. I'll never understand that. I'll never be okay with that. Never."

And then maybe their children will never call another child ugly simply because they do not match the ideal of white beauty.
"The first is exactly the opposite of the senility theory: the repetitions aren’t signs of senility and age, but of perpetual youth and vitality. We wouldn’t be surprised to see this in a man so delighted with the prospect of eternal life. G. K. Chesterton once wrote that children, precisely because of their vitality, always say “’do it again’; and the grown-up person does it again until he is nearly dead.”[4] John loves repetition the way children love repetition. If we don’t feel like keeping up with him, it is because he is younger than we."
Having small kids has taught me to appreciate the unexpected. Remember to have patience and that everything happens for a reason. Sometimes the detour can be the best thing that happened!
"Recently, a friend referred to me as a woman, and I wondered when this happened. I mean, obviously I was always female, but when did I make the transition from girl to woman? When do any of us? Is it an age thing? Does it happen with life’s milestones like graduation/marriage/motherhood? Does it happen when we become the kind of woman we want to become or does it just happen while we’re just merrily going on our way? Do we have any control over it at all?"

"The course was through a housing area so the asphalt was great, but the path consisted of about 4 out and backs going up side streets, around a chair and back down. Coming up on the finishing chute I could hear someone on my heels and picked up the pace not to be passed. He picked it up too and we duked it out, but I stayed ahead of him and hit the chute first. I was moving so fast I couldn't slow down before crashing into the person in front of me, LOL. We laughed and thanked each other for the final kick. I didn't think I would win anything since the age groups were 10 year spans and I lost so much time in the second half, but I managed a 3rd place medal and got to walk to the front in my bare feet :-)"
"Despite its protective properties, the denial of our animal nature can have serious costs for health and well-being. Reminders of mortality have been shown, for example, to decrease women's intentions to conduct breast self-examinations, and might also fuel body objectification, which is known to damage mental health. Not only can this denial hurt our health, but it may undermine our very humanity and sense of aliveness. As Becker put it, ""The irony of man's condition is that the deepest need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation; but it is life itself which awakens it, and so we must shrink from being fully alive"" (cited in Goldenberg et al., 2009)."

The sound of its churning approach would be muffled by the running water, and no one would be in time to save my beautiful face from being eaten off. It would be a messy, painful death, I reflected with distaste as I shampooed, but at least my blood would wash down the drain easily enough. Save my mother a bit of labor."

"Quite clearly this is Blackpool, Lancashire and not New York, New York and therefore I can't be accused of somehow cleverly following up on the still from the 1912 film ""The New York Hat"" which served as the theme photo this week. Equally, charming though Uncle Frank's mother undoubtedly was (I regret to say that I never had the pleasure), nobody would suggest that she was as beautiful as the young Mary Pickford (yes, it was she in the theme photograph). So, there you are, a completely random and non-thematic photograph ...... which just, by chance, seems to feature rather a lot of hats."
"Omens are another way Messenger Angels relay messages to humans on Earth. In fact, omens may very well be the most common way of doing so. If you think about the Biblical scripture you will remember that in the very first book of Genesis it says that “there shall be signs in the Sun, Moon, and stars.” Omens are signs; omens are portents. Since these scriptures date back thousands of years it is fair to say that signs have become a familiar thing, especially among the ancient peoples. They looked to signs to predict the weather, to predict the success of crops, to predict famine, war, and other monumental human events. People have long paid attention to signs and omens. When a sign appears in the heavens it does not appear to one race or nation, but is seen by the eyes of people worldwide."

I remember just sitting in my bed thinking about what to do, what to say, and who to talk to, I continued to repeat, “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do.” I truly did not know what to do. I did not want to call the missions organization and say I could not go, but at the same time I did not have the money to afford the trip. It was definitely a moment of weakness and confusion. I truly did not understand that if it was my purpose to go on this trip why was it so difficult to come up with the money."

"Back in January I posted the sophomore effort from Portal, Lost in The Translation and I was pleasantly surprised to hear from folks how much they liked it or were looking for it for years, lost their copy or whatever. So without further delay I happy to finally share the debut release from Portal. For those who missed that first post, Portal was a experimental home recording project by Contra/Church of the Rowdy guitarist Stephe Cooper. In these home experiments Cooper employed various genres-prog rock, art rock, kraut rock, midi/electronic music, ambient and even lo fi garage punk. I think Lost in The Translation is a much more calculated, though out work thus to my ears being a bit more enjoyable than the debut, however this disc is certainly enjoyable and firmly lays the groundwork of what was to come. Honestly, it is a shame that Cooper only released two Portal cds because both are so damn good. This debut cd-r features a Jane's Addiction cover."

But noise is news; noise gets priority."

"Upon my return to Atlanta after my first early-90s sojourn to New York, this statement rang in my head for years. I had always hoped to return to New York, but Atlanta had clawed me in its grips, as hometowns often do. Yeah, my life was there, but my heart was way up north. And now, here I was, with Steve driving a car speeding its way to the home of the man who made this statement that had stuck with me so. On the way up, I bought a copy of Levon's memoir (co-written by Stephen Davis) called This Wheel's On Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of The Band. Steve and I stopped at two hotel rooms (one in North Carolina and one in New Jersey), and I read as much of the book as I could. I had never really known about the rancor within The Band, but Levon's book clued me in on why Robbie Robertson was the sole songwriter credited for all their songs: it was a lawyerin' thing."

It also led me to change to a more body building approach from the get-go even though it is a little counteractive to a pure weight loss program. I want more muscle because it will help kick up the metabolism (even if it only turns out to be small% gain – I need every % I can get). Weight training also helps fight osteoporosis. Plus the endorphins from exercise help mood and energy. So does looking ripped."
"Another part of the article I object to is the idea that kids make marriages worse. In essence, it says that kids place quite a strain on a marriage, although it only discusses one type of family--one where both the mother and father work outside of the home, and wait until their mid thirties to have their first kid (and possibly last kid). I have only had a kid for a few months, but it is a bit of a shock in the personal freedom department, and I am still learning how to balance my needs and wants with Luthien's. It's been hard figuring out how to be married and how to raise a baby at the same time. I don't see the logic in the article on this point though. Facing and overcoming challenges in a marriage should serve to strengthen it, not weaken it. But this article seems to say that once a couple has children their relationship is only about the kids. I have seen this first hand, but I have also seen marriages that are still awesome and fully functioning with several children. I think couples have to be careful not to let their marriage slide after having kids, rather they need to use the challenges to strengthen and grow their marriage. It reminds me how important it is to make my marriage a priority. I think that because Andy and I will have dealt with this balance between marriage and children from the beginning we will be able to learn the necessary skills to keep both healthy. This isn't to say that couples who have children later can't do this, just that for us it is good to do it early on."

"I arrived in Indianapolis on Thursday, the day before the festival. The hotel is within walking distance of five other hotels...and nothing else. Well, almost nothing else. I was given a room on the first floor which I didn’t think anything of because I did a quick walkthrough and discovered that it was far enough away from the majority of the action to not be a bother. So then I realize that I hadn’t eaten since a granola bar that morning so I order room service. No answer. Huh. Okay, so I go to the restaurant. No one’s there. Apparently, one needs to be a semaphore to get food in this joint. I go back to my room and try to call room service one more time. No dice."
"Now we might specify that defeat of a bill in the second chamber never constitutes a loss of confidence in the government, so that it does not trigger resignation or dissolution. But then, we need a mechanism other than an election for getting over the conflict between the two chambers, at least for those bills that need to be passed, such as budgets. How this is to be done is not obvious (though not impossible), but whatever mechanism is, its existence dilutes the power of the second chamber to reject the government’s proposals and thus diminishes the benefits Waldron hopes for it."

The authors acknowledged that, these days, their victims are often sympathetic people. Burke explained that, as a reader, she was tired of the victim just being ""victim number 7 -- and they had no tie to the life that was lost. It was always important to me that the loss of life would be depicted."""
"Pantheism offers the idea that everything is god or a part of god. Beliefs such as Hinduism, propose that 390+ million gods exist, evil is illusory (an illusion or perceptual, open to interpretation), the universe is essential eternal (so creation is not linear but circular), SO, other principles such as rebirth of souls (reincarnation), and a guiding code such as Karma must be in place (this to provide for inevitable progression or digression of the succession of a person’s existence until they become one with a transpersonal god as the ideal reality)."

"On this Easter weekend, I have memories of standing outside Mamaw’s house, in front of whatever shrub was in full bloom, dressed in my best suit and tight, shiny black shoes, getting my picture made with mean sisters, bossy cousins, and everyone else in the family. So many pictures I couldn’t see after the flashes were finished. But glad to be finished with the pretty part of Easter, we were able to tear off our ties, change our shoes, shed coats and sometimes shirts, and get busy hiding and finding eggs all over the yard, stopping only long enough to eat jelly beans and chocolate bunny ears. Wearing black beads and needing naps, we made the long journey home complete with baskets of cracked, colored eggs we would keep for weeks in our treasure troves. Just a word of advice, don’t eat those things after the third day. Take my word on that."

Superman was a big property for Warner Brothers at the time and Pryor was box office gold. But only in a studio executive’s mind could those things go together and make something good."

"“The thing about the word ‘broken’ is it implies that it is ruined. Or that, even if it can be put back together, it will never look presentable. Like if you break a ceramic plate into a million little pieces and you glue every single one back together, no one would want to hang that plate on the wall. But did you know that when you put a piece of ceramic stone in the kiln, the heat automatically creates millions of litte cracks…that were meant to be there? So the stone ends up being cracked…but in a beautiful way. People end up paying thousands of dollars for what appears to be a cracked piece of stone. So maybe we’re just not broken, but just beautifully cracked. And that’s the way it was meant to be.”"

"A more recent example is the murder trial of Altantuya Shaariibuu, with which Prime Minister Najib Razak is said to be entangled. The trial started in January 2007, but the appeal has not even heard in the Court of Appeal five years later, and looks set to be further delayed until after the next general election. Obviously, someone up there does not want it to be heard so soon for obvious reason."

"Second, in Eyes Like Leaves, I love the main narrative thread involving Tarn and Carrie. There is a very nice sequence in the second hundred pages, for instance, where they have to shapeshift into the form of evil creatures to evade their pursuers, but then Tarn starts to lose himself in the role. But the sequences from the point of view of Puretongue and various side characters -- there are a surprising number of POV shifts in the second hundred pages -- are less compelling to me. In those other sequences, I was always anxious to get back to Tarn and Carrie."

"1. The Church started, not in Rome, nor in Germany, England, or Switzerland, but in the East, in Jerusalem, the City of our Lord, and city from which all the Apostles set out. As the Gospel of Luke says, “repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem” (Lk 24.47); and as it reads in the Acts of the Apostles: “you shall be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, and in Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1.8). The Orthodox Church of Christ (sometimes called “Eastern Orthodox” or “Greek Orthodox”) is the native Church of the Holy Land, and has owned and operated the most holy sites in Christendom for the past two millennia. The families that are the descendants of those first disciples of Jesus have lived continuously in the Holy Land as devout Orthodox Faithful for the past 2000 years, for the Church of Jerusalem following the Great Schism of 1054, would remain part of the Orthodox Church, not the Roman Catholic Church, although Rome would later establish a presence there."

(In the rhetorical sense, I mean, not in the sense of what fashionable Renaissance dudes like Mike Cassio are wearing.) I hope I can remember some of the examples when I teach Othello in the fall, because the whole paper was an incredibly sharp demonstration of why close reading matters, and how words shape character and vice versa. (I always feel like I'm swimming against the stream when I try to teach close attention to language; most of my colleagues apparently don't, and the students sure as heck are not getting it in high school like I did. I've been having students memorize and recite passages in the Shakespeare class these last few semesters, which seems to help a bit. At least that way they have to look at every word.)"

"We stayed at a hotel in Coconut Grove because 30 something years ago George spent a month there and remembered it fondly. Mitchell Kaplan, who owns Books&Books, one of the great independent bookstores in the country, was a huge help in scheduling a couple of Obama events for me. The most interesting was at a Hebrew Day school in Miami Beach. The campaign freaked out because Joe Lieberman was speaking at the same school the following night. They were sure I'd be asked questions about Israel that I wouldn't be able to answer so they sent two experts on the middle east. This was supposed to be an informal gathering of moms (and some dads) with the middle schoolers. I doubt they would have asked me any hard questions about the middle east. But this way I didn't have to worry. And neither did the campaign."

"Nimbus Brewing Company sits in a similarly gritty part of Tucson and is located not too far from Barrios – though you wouldn’t know it from the drive because streets and traffic in Tucson are a bit of a nightmare. The thing that sets Nimbus’ location apart – I think - is its proximity to Davis Monthan Air Force Base. (That, and the giant hand protruding from the front of the building…holding, what else? A beer.) Johnny Southside and I took a couple of seats on the patio where we could watch the A-10 Warthogs coming in on approach just across the railroad tracks. We ordered up a dose of onion rings from a scruffy-faced bartender and I had a pint of Porter that didn’t appear to be on the printed menu. (Nimbus offers six beers packaged in bottles for sale but there are more beers available at the brewery.) The porter looked, smelled and tasted just like a porter should in my book; faintly sweet tasting with a hint of chocolate. I’d give it high marks and only regret that it isn’t one of the beers they offer for sale in bottles. I bought a t-shirt as a souvenir of the visit and in short order we were back on the road, never suspecting for a moment that we’d never actually get to Bisbee on this trip."

"Native to most of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, asparagus has been cultivated since ancient times, and a recipe for preparing the vegetable even exists in the earliest surviving cookbook from the 3rd century AD. Picked before the shoots ripen (they get harder and less edible when ripe), asparagus can be eaten as the white or green varieties (white asparagus, which is milder in flavor, has been grown without much exposure to the sun) and cooked fresh or pickled to stay for months. They’re a very healthy vegetable, providing tons of fiber, potassium, and vitamin C, and is used as a diuretic. An early bird in the vegetable family, the harvesting season for asparagus starts in late April and runs through June–meaning that May is the perfect time to get fresh, delicious asparagus straight from the farmer’s market. Slap on a little hollandaise sauce and those shoots are ready to go!"

"Next, you’ll want to prep your meat. For the white meat chicken: I took one large chicken breast, trimmed it (I’m picky about chicken in that I don’t like “googlies.” One of the billion advantages of cooking at home — you know every single thing that’s going into your food!). Then, I sliced the breast into half-inch medallion-like pieces. I rubbed each piece with some veggie oil, placed it on a sheet of saran wrap, covered with another sheet of saran wrap, and pounded each piece to half its original thickness. This is definitely not necessary, but I love thin pieces of chicken best (mostly because they have more surface area which means more places for sauce to stick). Makes them extra tender too. Totally fine to skip the pounding though. I threaded the chicken pieces onto wooden skewers that I had soaked in water for a bit so they don’t catch fire on the grill."

Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk, adding the dry ingredients in 3 additions and the milk in 2 (begin and end with the dry ingredients); scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed and mix only until the ingredients disappear into the batter. Divide the batter evenly between the two pans and smooth the tops with a rubber spatula."
"Which brings me back to my comment about the ""roller coaster"". We know the Bible says we will have difficulties in this life. We will all face challenges, and go through trials. That is a part of life this side of Heaven. Just be aware that when we are facing tough circumstances, that's when we're most vulnerable. We must be alert to not allow the devil to use the above tools to attack our minds and emotions."

Mum and Dad headed into the Katherine Museum for a look around (and said it was worth a visit and great to see the movie and photos relating to the massive floods they have had here).

"But unfortunately, there’s something implanted in my brain that stops me from such spontaneity and downright irresponsibility, stops me from picking up the crack whore on the corner, stops me from ingesting meth, stops me at beer 6, stops me from cheating on my wife, stops me from slapping the fuck out of people when they really deserve it, stops me from trying to fly from every bridge I cross and keeps me only smoking pot occasionally."
"Chhepu is the central character in a legend about the creation of the valley in which the ancient city of Kathmandu stands. In that legend, one of a number that can be traced back to the 4th or 5th century AD, Chhepu lived first in the muddy bottom of the lake which filled the valley. And then, when the lake had emptied through a gap made in the surrounding hills by an inquisitive giant, deep under the valley’s floor."
"The best part is, it is led by black Americans who have for generations been the ones screaming loudest of over bearing police, so that the moment they get into power, they prove even worse."

Christians pay respect and honor to those to whom they are due. Romans 13:7- “Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.”
"I have to applaud Toyota Motor Corp. on its ingenuity and forward-thinking. Clearly, the population of Japan has exploded and there is a limited number of people able to or willing to take care of the nation’s elderly. Toyota has a cure-all for this problem…the robo-nurse. The developers state that they designed the robot to resemble a teddy bear so it would be non-threatening. Really. Because if I woke up in the middle of the night and saw that face in my room, I would freak out and hit it with a bat until that smile-moustache-thingy on its face was completely demolished."
"comfortable with yourself, and learn your body and what feels good. This, my friends, will make your sex life MUCH better. Once you are comfortable and can learn what makes you cum, then you can teach your partner, or do it yourself when you’re fucking, and sex just got a whole lot more interesting."
"As the women left the house at 610 N. Buchanan Blvd tempers became frayed and some sharp words were exchanged and one of the boys, again not one of those who later faced charges, made the mistake of using the infamous “N” word, although, he did not do so until after the second dancer had accused the players of being “Skinny dicked white boys”. Another player made a somewhat obscure comment asking the women to thank their grandparents for his “fine cotton shirt” which the media later determined to be a reference to slavery and therefore condemned the team to lasting allegations of racism."

"“With the addition of a new state-of-the-art hospital and ancillary facilities Caymanians will have access to world class health care without having to travel abroad,” he said."
"The Witness was also sent a photograph of NPC 3260, a grey Toyota Corolla, late last week and yesterday received an e-mail showing a car bearing NPC 3228 plates."
"He explained that they hadn’t meant us any harm, they were just curious about us. He went on to reveal how one of the people they had been studying had suddenly died. They had never seen something die before, unlike us their bodies continually rejuvenate their cells, diseases, aging, death were as alien to them as the images he passed through my mind were to me. He went on to explain how they had been resurrecting our dead in hopes of understanding what it truly meant to die. None of them realized that the radiation they were exposing the corpses to during their revitalization process would have the effect it did on our bio-chemistry. He tried to explain in terms I could grasp that they had been using a medical device designed to speed up cellular growth and heal injuries to revitalize our dead. The radiation he explained, acted like a charger energizing a dead battery as it were. Our cells however were too fragile to handle the process, and as the bodies continued to break down it released the radiation. When the radiation came into contact with our living matter it overloaded our cells destroying them while simultaneously trying to restore them in effect locking the person exposed in a perpetual death state."
"Uptown opens with another (yawn) jazz ode to Manhattan which is made more curious by the fact that David Basse is the acknowledged “leader” of the Kansas City jazz scene. In fact, two of the first three tracks are New York-centric which would be a little bit tedious even by a New York based jazz singer. And a mention of stepping out in a top hat, really, in 2012?"
We must not forget that the ruling class would resist to the end.
Close your eyes and imagine the floor beneath your feet—cool hardwood maybe. Or softly warm and carpeted. Sit down and lift your feet up off of it and imagine you can never put them down on it again. Ever. See how quickly the feeling of the floor fades? See how much you want to feel it again? How lost you feel with no place to put your feet?
There is a lot of academic theory that explain how people interpret visual communication and is still growing today. Visual culture regards images as culturally specific and therefore understanding of semiotics is equally localised.
"Life has settled down to a routine lately since I came back. The bf has been overseas for more than a month, and I am not sure when he is coming back. So I've been using the extra time to bake and make desserts quite a bit. I miss traveling and wish I can do more of that this year, especially now that I still have a valid US entry visa for about 9 months left. Summer is here (or almost) and everyone seems to be in a traveling mode, and so do I. My next trip will be during memorial day weekend down to Louisiana to visit the bf's family and hopefully it won't get canceled last minute due to work (which has happened a lot before)"

"All candidates should be vetted and should understand that “We the People” are the actual ones they answer to. Lets not give our freedom up to those with a polished speech that holds no substance. So whether you are bored by the debates and all the political talk, remember that this all comes down to us doing our job!! I’ve been told more than once that work would not always be fun and would be boring at times, but that is what is required in order to live freely. So, for those of us who took the holidays off and are resistant to jumping back into the fray…saddle up and lets get busy!"

Of course there’s no intrinsic need to take either representation or inference as derivative of the other – both concepts could be explanatorily fundamental. But Brandom thinks he can show that reference is derivative of inference – thereby going against much of the modern analytic tradition.

"The Stoics believe you have no control whatsoever over your life, what happens to you, or what you achieve. The only thing a Stoic believes you can control is your attitude. For the Stoic, the ideal attitude was to be calm and free of passion. If one was able to attain this virtue, then one could be happy, regardless of what happened in life, making you immune to misfortune."

"If you have never read a book on marriage before, MacDonald’s Magnificent Marriage can get you on the right track. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with the book, but in comparison to what is available in marriage books, there’s little good about it either. Instead of MacDonald’s book, go and find a copy of one (or both) of the following two books: first, John Gottman’s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, which is the most practically useful book on marriage I’ve ever read. The other book is Mike Mason’s The Mystery of Marriage, which is the most theologically stirring and poetic meditation on marriage I’ve read."
My eyes welled up I tried to fight the lump in my throat and fight off the tears but I could do it no longer. A few short minutes later a DSS worker walked into the room said her father (Angelo) was here and it was now tike for me to say good bye!
"I love snowmobiling. Flying over the snow, catching air over drifts. I love to drive, to be at the helm of the beast as I weave around trees and over hill and dale, my husband sitting behind me. I also love riding behind my husband as he drives, feeling those powerful arms as he’s muscling the snowmobile into the wilds. We follow unknown trails, driven by a Magellan spirit, hoping that we have enough gas to get us back to civilization. I love hanging on, simply trusting him, knowing that wherever he’s taking me, he’s going first."
"There’s a very particular structure to comics stories where superheroes meet for the first time, and The Avengers adheres to this with admirable fidelity, for the most part. First of all you get the sequences introducing everyone individually and demonstrating what their schtick is, and these are present (mostly). Then, before battle is joined with the actual villain, there is the inevitable misunderstanding and/or clash of egos resulting in the good guys knocking seven bells out of each other at great length. This sort of thing fuels the perpetual ‘Who would win in a fight between…’ debates comic fans love, and The Avengers goes for this with great enthusiasm. The initial barney between Thor and Iron Man is jolly enough, but I was particularly delighted later one when the story finds time for a proper scrap between Thor and the Hulk. Once this is out of the way it’s time for some regrouping and laying in of plot ahead of the final battle."

"Notably, the FBI subsequently received from the Public Health Service two charts displaying the outbreaks of plague in both New Mexico and the continental United States during that period. And as the FBI noted with respect to the Public Health Service: “…they have found positive evidence of the plague among wild rodents in the states lying west of a line directly north of the east boundary of the state of New Mexico.”"

"It’s day 4 of 2012, this funny first week when we all reappear from the Christmas break, still trying to remember what we did before the Christmas madness hit us all and getting ready for the new year in front of us. We all have made some sort of resolutions – be it not to eat another biscuit, have another glass of wine or to finally tidy up and declutter the house. Some resolutions will survive the storm of daily life, others will quietly disappear without any acknowledgement from us that they ever existed."

"Well, SOMEONE thought it was a good idea, and that someone was Independent International Pictures... which just happened to specialize in every single one of Adamson's films... that's just a coincidence though, pay it no mind. But yeah, by the opening of the Seventies, Adamson had made bad biker movies and bad monster movies, about in equal measure. What could he do to try and appeal to all of his films' fans (that is, the monster fans and the biker fans)?"
"All joking aside, I haven't been in a chocolate mood lately, so I searched for a lemon-flavored bundt. I ended up using Ina Garten's lemon yogurt cake. It has triple-whammy lemony goodness with lemon zest and lemon oil in the cake, lemon syrup drizzled over the hot cake, and a creamy, lemon glaze to finish it off."
"But, in this case, as with the proposals for bureaucratic control over “High Pay”, or the Tories mangled proposals over Child Benefit it is not the truly rich who are being targeted, it is not the Capitalists who make millions of pounds from their Capital alone, each year, but the Middle Class, and the purpose of that is to cover the real attack, which is on the workers below them, who will lose out proportionately more, once again. Hutton himself had to admit that the average Public Sector Pension was modest, but that didn't stop him arguing for cutting it! It didn't stop him arguing that the one piece of certainty that Public Sector workers have – that they have some idea what their pension will be when they finish work – should be removed with the scrapping of Final Salary Schemes."

"I took it upon myself to begin some stretching exercises, because if I sat around waiting for my doc to send me for physio or something, I'd be waiting a hella long time, my next appointment to see him is in three months. I'm going very slow with the movements, I do as much as pain will allow of course, but I figure the answer is not to curl up in a ball and stiffen up completely, I gotta keep on keepin' on. Who knows, perhaps by springtime I will be able to start taking my beloved walks again! Yup ;)"

"If you've never been to an authentic Ethiopian restaurant, it is quite an experience. For starters, there is no silverware! Dishes from your meal are laid out on a round piece of very thin bread, much resembling a crepe. You are given a basket of the same bread, which you tear into small strips and use to scoop up your food. Essentially, you are eating with your hands. The food at KoKoB was heavily aromatic and spiced to perfection. I had a combo of 3 dishes - carrots and green beans in a mild sauce, pea flour and shallots in a spicy sauce, and potatoes and beetroot in a rich sauce. The potato/beet dish was the winner, but they all held their own. So, if you ever find yourself in Brussels, make your way down to KoKoB for a proper Ethiopian feast :)"

"A lot crammed in there, more than I would've suspected would have fit in a single issue of Ms. Marvel. The story also features a closing recap of what would happen to Carol, up to becoming Binary, which was a cool look but a worse name than Warbird. I prefer her keeping ""Ms. Marvel,"" as a tribute to Captain Marvel...but Carol getting promoted doesn't sound bad either."

"It's been a bit of a week again. I seem to do this every year before Christmas. When other people are panic-buying mince pies, batteries, stuffing mix and party nibbles as if they'll never be available on the shelves ever again, I'm doing the same with books! Needless to say, our postman and the local courier delivery men have been rather busy of late..."
"The salad followed the standard formula: mixed greens + fruit+ cheese (tart Granny Smith apples and crumbled smoked fontina from Willamette Valley Cheese Company). The vinaigrette was a loose pistou of nettles, honey, walnut oil, balsamic and sherry vinegars, minced shallot and Dijon mustard. A crunch of salt and pepper finished the salad."

"The aroma was filled with the recognizable smell of Smith and Cross: strong, funky and full of promise. Of course the molasses was there as well, though I am still not sure if I was smelling the actual molasses or the Smith and Cross. Also, the pineapple spear, which was an utter garnish failure, awkward protuberance that it was, added a bit of undefinable fruitiness to the nose. The first sip was very molasses-y, though the hogo of the rum carried through at the end. You would think that there would be some sweetness in this drink, but it was dry and earthy, with a vague powdery texture that made each sip seem almost chewy. After I increased the bitters, the spices became more detectable on the swallow. The flavors of the molasses were also enhanced by the increase in bitters--the drink seemed sweeter, in that pleasing molasses cookie way, and the flavors in general seemed more balanced. Overall, not bad but not great."
"Odin’s wife, Frigga—strangely played by Rene Russo—has two or three lines. Sif, the warrior maiden who accompanies Thor on his first adventure, also has a handful of lines. Natalie Portman provides no real importance to the plot. The women are on the sidelines. They aren’t important. Only the men are. The men rule, the women do not."

(Which true confession I'm not totally sure is a good use of Intermediate Value Theorem day but I kind of suspect is it, so I went with it.) There was a distinct, entrenched camp arguing ""no,"" and a diverse, poorly-organized camp valiantly arguing ""yes,"" and the ""no's"" were very gracious when they realized their position was untenable."
"However, I like to discuss this topic with other people. I've tried to get to the bottom of why people my age do these things. Why go to a party and get drunk? I've never seen the excitement in that idea. Most people came to the same conclusion: it's just fun. It's an escape. It's something different; it's simply something to do. It can also be a release; a way to let loose."

Notwithstanding these conceptual challenges, the water wars thesis is used by decision makers and by political leaders in order to focus attention on global resource issues – and their particular basin concerns. In the main, these serve immediate political ends. Boutros-Boutros Ghali is on record as stating in the mid-1980s that “The next war in the Middle East will be fought over water, not politics.” And in the mid-1990s Ismail Serageldin of theWorld Bank warned that “If the wars of this century were fought over oil, the wars of the next century will be fought over water – unless we change our approach to managing this precious and vital resource.” Such concerns and warnings rarely attempt to interrogate the realities of conflict over rivers such as the Nile, but instead feed on widely perceived notions of insecurity and vulnerability within domestic populations. These feelings are often driven by public perceptions of the challenges facing shared river basins and their societies, and the political actors are feeding on and responding to those perceptions. Some of these wider perceptions will also have resulted from external factors such as the impact of drought in the Horn of Africa and on Nile flows during the 1980s.

In the summer months the emphasis is largely on the tourist industry. After the last charter flight leaves in October, Crete is devoted to farming and agriculture. They harvest their olives, oranges and other products. There are no direct flights at all to Crete during this period (only via Athens), but in March the flights resume and tourism becomes important once more.

I started this blanket on the first of September so you can see it's quite a quick blanket to produce. I'm sure I could have completed it quicker if I hadn't been so busy. As I've said before granny squares are great projects to do when you don't feel like concentrating too much . They are so relaxing. Another bonus is the relatively small number of ends to sew in. Two for each row means 114 for the whole blanket...only takes an hour or so :0)

It is interesting to consider these findings when reading last year’s FDA Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) report on menthol (available here). It appears that TPSAC deliberately downplayed the Blot lung cancer findings, while discussing other findings in detail. The Stellman study was not even mentioned.
A couple of months later I began to see the effect of the shift. I first noticed it when someone said, ‘I come to the BURN because it’s a place where I can count on meeting God’. My heart soared and cried all at once! They were saying that about Bradford’s BURN! Later, another said, ‘This is going to sound weird because I haven’t spoken to any of you before, but after worshipping with you I feel like I love you all’. That one brought tears of joy to my eyes – I have had that experience myself, where the Lord knits your heart together with people you barely know, but who become incredibly dear to you after simply worshipping together with them for a few hours. For me, those people have become like close family. But this was the first time I had heard someone say that of the BURN in Bradford!

I cannot speak to the mesmeric force of beards, though I do confess to an instinctive distrust of clean-shaven men. But was the loss of Yeats' beard for good or ill"" at the aesthetic (as opposed to the mesmeric) level? You be the judge. The photo above depicts Yeats not long before the loss of his beard. The photo below comes from the 1890s, when (if I may editorialize) the transformation from Dashing Young Rake to Canned Ham with Hair was complete."
"In its role as the abstract representation of value, money has done its job almost too well. For us it has become another form of mana, another form of life-blood. Its flow in and out of our lives seems to determine so many aspects of our quality of life. Is it any wonder that we cling to it so?"

"The one word that seems to be overused in the wrong context is ‘of’ – ie: “I am fed up of the weather.” “I would of taken the short route” “you could of told me earlier” &etc. the ‘of’ word seems to have taken place of ‘with’ and ‘have’…. Now I also noticed that most of the offenders are under 40 years old, so have deduced that it is either the fault of the education authorities dumbing down their English lessons and examinations, or the dumbing down of the spoken word. I must admit I enjoy the English language and have always tried to ensure that my spelling and grammar is correct – possibly to do with my strict teachers!"
"The Buddhist view is compatible with all three of those statements – or at least has things in common with each of them; but differs also in a seemingly small but significant way. It is elegant, simple and radical in its scope and implications. The proposition put forward by Buddhism is that there is already in reality no separation between this 'me' and the rest of the universe. Our perception of duality, of 'me' versus 'you' or 'it', is the result of millenia of conditioned habituation to the notion of a separate egoic self, and our enormous efforts to preserve and defend our identity as this separate 'self'."

"I was a little curious how it was going to go with Bob, we didn't get along all that great when I worked there. Looking back, I am quite ready to take the blame for that. I suspect that as a brash youth, I was unable to recognize that we were very much alike and I probably should have known just to keep my mouth shut. Though much better now, that is something that I have had to work on for my entire career. Bob ended up retiring from Cal-Fire as a B.C. and still lives in town. We had a nice chat, it was good speaking with him. I wish him well."

"This week on Life Full Circle Radio, we will look at the price of fame. Unfortunately, Whitney Houston was not the first or the last public figure to succumb to the pressures of fame and turn to substances to ease the pain. There are many stories of artists like Rick James, Curt Cobain, Luther Vandross, Tupac, Notorious B.I.G, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and many more that chronicle the lives of stars that shined bright and died at early ages."
"Before all this takes place though you have to drink this liquid laxative stuff called phosphorescent citrate of manitoba for two days. This is so they can see the forest through the trees, or at least the forest without all the bear crap laying all over the ground or however that goes. Man does this stuff clean you out. Much to my surprise it tasted pretty good. Kind of like Squirt soda, appropriately enough. You should plan on taking your pants off altogether and sitting on the toilet for that entire couple of days while this stuff does its job since as soon as it goes in, it comes RIGHT OUT. At velocity. And it ain't over till the fat lady sings...or in this case, till the fat lady shits clear for at least an hour. And the fat lady did. The fat lady about took the shine off the enamel. All the trees in that forest blew down."
That is so nice. But keep in mind it’s a gesture with a price tag.
"Conclusion: The food here is very fresh, very tasty, well presented and I doubt you can go wrong with any of their dishes; my only complaint is their prices. My wife says her meal was worth the money and I think therein lies the issue, they have priced up all the meat dishes well, but when it came to the vegetarian dishes instead of looking at what they were giving the customer they just looked at the general prices across the menu and said “well, there’s no meat, so just knock a couple of quid off and keep them somewhat inline with the rest of the prices on the menu”. A simple fix to that of course is not to change the prices, but to just give a little more on the veggie plates where the meat would have been. There is no denying the food here is good. We’ll be back again, but with prices like these I don’t think it will be for a long time. If you’re in the area and want really good food and have money to throw around here is the place to pop into – if you just want a meal and don’t want to break the bank its probably best to pop over to the huntsman across the road. Whilst the staff didn’t mind at all I would say The Swan Inn attracts a certain type of customer who don’t really want to be bothered by children, so I would say only take the kids if they’re older or if younger, well behaved. Lastly the menu did lack options on it, it would have been really good to see a veggie burger on there because there’s no way for a veggie to have any onion rings, handcut chips or any of the niceties that come accompained with the other meals (had I been alone I would never have been able to compliment the delcious homemade coleslaw). So a homemade veggie burger option would be much welcomed. Other than that I would recommend coming in when the restaurant is open as by the looks of that menu, whilst still expensively priced, there are more options for us veg-heads."

"We headed up to Olathe, to celebrate my dad's birthday, but he had meetings. So, really I was able to give him his birthday present and talk a little before he left. Chris so kindly watched over Ben and Kira while mom and I took the younger girls shopping with us. We went to the Book Sale at the Library, Michael's, Ulta, Party City, Chic-fil-a, and Children's Orchard. Instead of making the girls all matching skirts to match Cecilia's blessing dress, I bought the girls jean skirts and white shirts, and cecilia has a white dress that I'm going to change up some. So, now I'm going to wait for my lace to come in and I'm going to use that and some ribbon to dress up the outfits and make matching hair bows. That will do, I hope! I'm trying to make life easier, instead of incredibly hard. I don't really know how to sew THAT well! Speaking of Cecilia though, I have her going home outfit now! Leah picked the sweater, so I grabbed the matching jeans and we already had two shirts at home that would match, so the hard part is choosing which shirt for her to come home in. I've got her clothes in drawers, diapers and wipes stored, and her bed next to mine. Now I just wait a couple of months to meet her!"

"Not really. That was how it was supposed to go down, but instead, #7 Tommy Wilbanks hits a real fence buster straight to right field. Jimmy Smith sees it coming, runs back—almost trips over his untied shoe laces—and snow cones it. The runner on third tags up and runs for home. Jimmy guns it to me at short. I throw it Billy Dugan, our catcher, who makes the tag just as the runner slides into home. He’s out, right? Right. Only we have the clumsiest umpire in the league. Mr.Willis trips over Billy’s catcher’s mask, misses the whole play, and calls the Comets’ runner safe. That call ends the ballgame. And the season. And our chance at regionals."

"4) DIGITAL ART -Digital art is a general term for a range of artistic works and practices that use digital technology as an essential part of the creative and/or presentation process. Since the 1970s, various names have been used to describe the process including computer art and multimedia art, and digital art is itself placed under the larger umbrella term new media art. The impact of digital technology has transformed traditional activities such as painting, drawing and sculpture, while new forms, such as net art, digital installation art, and virtual reality, have become recognized artistic practices. More generally the term digital artist is used to describe an artist who makes use of digital technologies in the production of art. In an expanded sense, “digital art” is a term applied to contemporary art that uses the methods of mass production or digital media."

"Hoping to follow on this success, Percival Lowell hoped to do something similar some 80 years later. Having then detected subtle perturbations in the orbit of Neptune, he funded the search for ""planet X"", a large planet even further out. Initial observations were less than successful...planet X's position had to be recalculated 3 times after initial searches turned up nothing. But, in 1930, Clyde Tombaugh observing at Lowell Observatory discovered a tiny light moving night-to-night. 40 AU out...this was it! Planet Pluto!

"After doing a little research about this new camera it appears that Nokia is not aiming to shoot hi-resolution images. Rather, their goal is on keeping as much detail as possible in the different shots the phone will take. What this means is once a shot is taken you can zoom in up to three times with no loss of detail. This makes each photograph appear as one huge image, providing much more scope for any desired editing."

Even now, nine years later, my anger rises to a level even Paxil can’t control as I think about the Necons’ two Wars of Choice. Now that it’s almost all over, let’s look at the results: [1]2,583 coalition deaths in Afghanistan; and oh yeah, those civilians who don’t matter much: 12,793 dead. In Iraq, the U.S. body count is 4,487 and those pesky civilians died to the tune of 162,000, which of course could be much more. That’s nearly 200,000 dead and countless others maimed and driven crazy. And oh yeah, $1.324 TRILLION was expended by the U.S. on both fronts. For what??

THE CATHOLIC KNIGHT: I am a Southern American man and I proudly define myself as a Dixiean. That term is not a very popular one at this time, but I insist on it, because it truly does define my REAL nationality. It is a nationality suppressed so successfully by the imperial reign of Washington DC that most of my countrymen have no knowledge of it. Many of my countrymen use the term Southerner or Southron instead, and of course there is nothing wrong with that, but in designating a term that is directional in nature, the next question that begs to be asked is southern to what?"" Thus we enter into the hyphenated identity of Southern-American or American-Southron. Again, nothing wrong with that, but I do see a slight problem. By using this terminology, the connection to the United States of America is implied, and thus my countryman identifies himself as an American primarily. If that is what one wants, then fine, but I am not an American by choice. I am an American by circumstance because my people were conquered by Washington DC about 150 years ago. Therefore I am a Dixiean. That is my real nationality. I insist. I look forward to the day when all my fellow countrymen will join me in using that term."

"Though considered highly homoerotic and a favorite myth of gay men (who are often highly narcissistic), Narcissus’ refusal of both male and female love points toward an almost asexual orientation (apart from his attempted/thwarted autoeroticism), and as a result he may appeal to the mystically-inclined of particular stripes who favor celibacy and sexual sublimation. As early as the myth was told, there was debate over its meaning, with the belief that Narcissus was not literally in love with himself, but legitimately thought it was another person he saw, with this view prevailing often into modern philosophical discourse. It could be a vision of the “masculine inner double” or “twin,” the projection of one’s animus-ideal spoken of by queer Jungians (e.g. Robert Hopcke), and discussed as early as Plato’s Symposium. The failure to realize this projection of one’s desires onto an exterior reality that rarely meets one’s standards is a difficulty which is at the root of many relationship difficulties in the lives of gay men."
"I remember taking a parenting class when my daughter was five, and my son 18 months and the teacher asked the class what attributes we hoped our children would have when they left the home at 18. WOW, talk about planning ahead! She told us to go home and have our spouses fill out the paper as well, and compare. That was an interesting exercise, as many of our spouses had differing views regarding the top five attributes. Once we did that, however, she explained that is was OUR model and our planning that would help us to help them achieve these traits. For although they are born with inherent traits, many are fostered in the home or in the community and unless we planned, they could pick up other, less appealing ones from other sources. That was the first time I realized that I had that much influence over a human being!"

Common problems to avoid:
"Descartes abjures the project of understanding what the world or organisms are in themselves. Instead, he proposes to understand them externally, by transferring our knowledge of mechanical devices as hypothetical stand-ins. Having made the metaphorical substitution of machine for world or organism, however, Descartes is also able to substitute a pragmatic view of the aims of inquiry for a theoretical one: since there is a surplus of possible mechanical constructions which could be made to stand in for any natural entity, the choice between them is made on the ground of what works best (and if the model works better than its natural counterpart, then it a truer example of the original function than what is in nature).

But this was mesmerizing, sweet pain — you couldn’t help but be drawn into the spectacle of a standard FM rock song being transformed into something new, with teeth.

"The Australian writer Val Plumwood believes that the nature/culture split can be changed by Ecocritical writing. Plumwood suggests giving voice to the more than human as a way of re-spiriting dead matter. In his poetic essay journey to the heart of stone, Plumwood discusses how writers can challenge, “The experiential framework of dead silent matter entrenched by the sado-disspassionate rationality of scientific reductionism” (Plumwood in Beckett & Gifford 2007, p18). The way to do this suggests Plumwood is to recover an understanding of matter as spirited. He calls for a project that encourages us to, “to think beyond these boundaries, to re-invest with speech, agency and meaning the silenced ones, including the earth and its very stones, cast as the most lifeless members of the earth community” (Plumwood in Beckett & Gifford 2007, p22). The writer can re-spirit matter by work that gives voice to the non-human. By doing this the writer can not only help open up space for the world to talk to human communities, but also they can help the human communities learn how to listen. This is a way of healing a wounded space."

"What unschoolers have captured is the beautiful realization that learning isn't separate from living. That in the process of living, learning happens. ALL*THE*TIME. When you're preparing for a birthday party, you're learning. When you're reading, watching tv, playing a video game you're learning. You're even learning as you rest or watch clouds drift by or sun yourself on the beach. It's impossible to not learn."

You don’t have a constitutional right to withdraw money from a bank account using a debit card. It was a banking gimmick to make money off people too irresponsible to have credit cards, and people too cowardly to carry large amounts of cash. It worked. A lot of people who are scared of buying cash and have no credit now use debit cards. (Nevermind that this means all their transactions are now data points for Big Brother.)"
"I can’t imagine bearing Saul’s guilt. Maybe that’s why so many choose self-denial instead of, “The Way?” It’s easier to be soulless than to finally see the pain you’ve caused to someone else.

"To celebrate Halloween and preserve my fondly held memories of the original 1966-’71 ABC TV series in the time before the Burton-Depp big screen reworking of the show comes out (and is either an absolute joy or a big-budget embarrassment), I hereby present an appreciation of the gothic soap opera Dark Shadows. The series scared the hell out of me as a child, but I still collected the trading cards, the comic books, and even the daily cartoon strips. As a young adult I was able to consume ample amounts of the show in reruns and found that it was both a really terrific horror TV show and a delightful piece of Sixties camp (that decade, as I note frequently on the Funhouse TV show, is the “gift that keeps on giving, and giving, and…”)."

"Nick Lowles should be ashamed of himself for using the deaths of innocent Norwegians to justify and further his anti-democratic campaign against all right-wing groups. He daren’t speak out directly against the Conservative Party - as the ‘capitalist party’ he thinks it is - for fear of digging his own grave. Better one step at a time. However, he did accuse David Cameron of 'pandering to racists and fascists' when he gave that critical speech on multicultural fundamentalism."
"The difficulty in describing Sigur Rós lies in the fact that they are virtually peerless. You’d be a lying bastard if you said you’d heard of a band like them before. Because of this lack of reference points, we end up having to use adjectives like “swirling” and pair them with objects like “glaciers” in a contrived attempt to describe the music - Listening to Sigur Rós is like being inside a swirling glacier...? Lame. The point is, it’s an arduous task articulating what’s so great about the group’s music when one of its defining characteristics is the ability to render you speechless. You just have to listen to it."

"Personally, I have always considered malt flavour a most important characteristic of first-class ale, both pale and mild, but of late years the increased demand for low gravity pale-coloured ales has greatly reduced the sale of full malt-flavoured ales. Pale malts being in such demand, the maltster is afraid to fire his malt high enough to develop much flavour, and consequently most of the pale ale of the present day lacks the delicate malt flavour which only a fair amount of firing, as distinct from curing, will produce.
This year, I was assigned to watch an action film called Deadly Prey (1987). You can tell this is from the 1980s right from the get-go with a wide shot of a silhouetted figure running up a hill and pumping a gun in the air, which leads into an opening-credits sequence that intercuts title cards with shots of all manner of weapons being loaded one at a time.

If you like paranormal stories and haven’t started this series yet, now is the time. The Grim Reaper Charley Davidson is back with just as much bite and snarky humor as ever. She’s not the usual grim reaper with the black hood and scythe and all, but one hot, badass chick with sarcasm oozing out of every pore. Her friends and coworkers are just as amusing as in the first two reads and even the nun…yeah, the nun, was pretty amusing! This is the first time I’ve listened to an audiobook of the series and I feel that Lorelei King did a great job at portraying all of the different characters. There is some heat to this series as well, and it doesn’t let up in this third book. Charley and Reyes are still hot and heavy and Cookie is still trying to live vicariously through Charley’s stories. There is no lack of action, if anything there might be more within this read. I can’t wait for the fourth book, Fourth Grave Beneath My Feet or the start of her new YA series Death and the Girl Next Door.

"Some parts of the book were a real challange. The one I particularly remember is the scene in the Giverny garden, with the Japanese bridge. It was so hard to ""extend"" the scene to the left. I looked at other paintings by Monet, as well as the modern garden layout, but it was hard to know what had changed. The bridge now has an elaborate pergola over it (this can been seen in some later paintings by Monet) which changes the view, for example. The path to the left is still there, so I included that. But the trees! I had to leave space for text! Well, the end result is inside the book - take a look in a bookshop and see what you think!"

"Can the SSF be reactivated once it is “permanently” shut down? Sarah was barren and then had her womb open in her old age. We call it a miracle (which it was) but what if there is also a natural and scientifically explanable way to take a woman out of menopause? If the SSF activates with multiple semen deposits and eventually turns “permanently off” with a lack of such semen, could the re-introduction of multiple semen deposits re-start the process? Semen isn’t just deposited and then drips out. It actually gets absorbed into the woman’s blood stream through the vagina. Science likes to isolate individual components of substances, trying to figure out the “active ingredients,” but sometimes isolation is not the name of the game. Like a fruit cocktail, sometimes it is the combination of ingredients that produces the effect, and not any of the individual components. Semen from multiple men may create just such a cocktail. We know, for example, that semen contains testosterone, estrogen and other hormones, such as prostaglandins (made in the prostate gland), luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Not all of the chemicals in semen have been identified (or isolated.) Could it be possible that male semen might actually regulate the female reproductive cycle, switching it both on and off?"
"But if my husband and I cannot work together on our finances, I’m not sure how all of this is going to work.

"Alfred Hitchcock is one of those Hollywood types whose films can be associated with various types of creative work.

Hitchcock even frequently discussed his use of the MacGuffin, put simply, whatever it was the protagonists were fighting over, be that secret plans or, typically in his films, some vague, unspecified crucial thing that sets up all the thriller elements."

"(source: Tom de Wet). A black female clerk in civilian clothes cursed Rhona, shouting that they would have to contact the detective themselves, and to ‘fkoff’ out of her police station. Then a male uniformed police officer jumped over the counter and beat Pieterse in the face several times. The couple then asked other police officials at the station to help them lodge a formal complaint against the cop who had assaulted him – but nobody wanted to help. Eventually the detective they’d enquired after, came to the police station. And then Pieterse was beaten by the same cop again – in front of the detective, who intervened.

"Teaching Practice (TP), of course, is at the very heart of the 4-week course, and is what made it both so terrifying and so exhilarating – and also so effective. In retrospect it seems amazing that such a perfectly obvious idea (i.e. to incorporate a practicum from Day 1) hadn’t been thought of before, or that – even today – it is so relatively rarely instituted on preservice teacher training programs, especially at tertiary level. Of course, it’s not just the teaching practice that is so formative: it is the collaborative planning and the tutor-led post-lesson feedback discussion, as well as the regular classroom observation, not to mention the way that the input sessions themselves cross-refer to teaching practice, so that – when it works well – the whole experience is entirely integrated, coherent and maximally practical."

"A fascination with time is pretty often linked, as in my case, with a predilection for all things calendrical. I'm not the only History Girl who feels this way. See H.M. Castor's post on this subject. I even have a character in my Stravaganza sequence of novels featuring alternative history in 16th century Italy, who is a Calendarist. (That is the Elizabethan alchemist Doctor Dethridge, for whom I have drawn heavily on the historical John Dee)."

"To the cinema of affects, therefore, rather than ask whether or not the plot of a film is realistic, we should ask, what affects does it send into the world? How does a film make us feel, make us think? We do not need to have easy answers for these questions. But a good film will make us feel and think much, and we limit ourselves unnecessarily by relying upon the outdated unities of character, plot, object and setting to do this."
"I can just about vote for the Conservatives with a clothes peg on my nose, and doubtless I will do so in a few weeks' time. But I won't work for it. The frustration is simply too great. I would much rather offer criticism and praise from the sidelines, according to mood. It is not a good thing to be contemptuous of any organisation whilst an officer (however lowly) within it."
"While Watson’s motivations behind the commission are unclear, six years after the painting shocked London viewers, he entered politics. An entry into this sphere brought with it the usual drawbacks of politically-motivated derisive commentary from his peers. The Rolliad (1812), a British satirical publication designed to poke fun at politicians, penned this scathing critique of Watson and the story that made him famous:"
"The medium, they say, is the message. Mobile phone is so possessive that the wives seem liberal and freedom-loving compared to them. You can spend hours on it, speaking to a friend, but imagine what happens when this same friend drops in. You make him sit in the drawing room, with a cup of tea, and are to the balcony, taking on the phone! Luckily, the friend does not mind, for he too is on the call."
"Kansas City first held a St. Patrick’s Day parade in 1873. Today the event draws a crowd of about 200,000 spectators. One of the things unique to this particular parade is that the grand prize winner of the procession gets an all-expense paid trip to Ireland, so participants really give it their all."

"The lines get blurry. A good measure of common sense and integrity on the part of ad agencies and their clients, would surely go a long way in helping to retain some sort of ethics. And for the most part, large companies don't lie about their products. The costs involved if they're caught are too great, and serve as a good deterrent. But when a message has to be delivered to millions of people, it's quite difficult to predict how all of them will perceive or construe it."

Berries, especially blueberries, are potent antioxidants that promote collagen which reduces wrinkles. Citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons and grapefruit help rid the body of free radicals keeping the skin looking young. Foods high in the antioxidant beta carotene including carrots and apricots protect the skin against sun damage."

"Everyone knows cats are cute and affectionate. Well, maybe the people who don’t have cats think that. Pia and Fluff are my two cats; Pia is lazy and can’t catch a bird if it waited for him. Pia spends his day lounging on Mom’s bed, then with much effort, gets up to get to his food-bowl, it takes more effort to get up the stairs and curl up again. We adopted Pia thinking he would be playful like a little kitten (which at the time he was a half-grown kitten). But we were wrong, he is the opposite."

"It may be the curriculum. Look at the nearest public school for this one. All teachers must teach to the curriculum, no exceptions, alternatives, or workarounds. And in recent years the curriculum has been strongly driven by standardized tests and the need to score well on them. This is even more pathetic than the basic idea of curriculum design where a bunch of soi disant experts get together to arbitrarily decide on what goes into the curriculum and what doesn't. Man! I am so reminded of the Council of Nicea, huh? Orthodoxy, orthodoxy, is our cry. O-r-tho-dox-y. Are we in it? Well, I guess! Orthodoxy, orthodoxy, yes, yes, yes!"
"Now, I think there is an important distinction to be made here: some parents proudly brag about how their teens aren't ""rebellious,"" and what they really mean is that their children are obedient to their parents wishes (or, possibly more likely, are simply very good at hiding the aspects of their life that their parents would disapprove of). When I say that most unschoolers I know, myself included, don't or didn't ""rebel"" against our parents in our teen years, I don't mean it's because we fit the perfect-child model of some narrow-minded authoritarian-parenting suburbanite."

"As the film opens, Simon and his band perform the title song at the Agora Ballroom in Cleveland. The mise en scène studiously captures both the vocal and instrumental labors of the group (there's a significance to this dual attention), with close views of the kick drum and guitar fretboards: this is a group with musical talent. Also, when the scene begins, we are mid-set, and every band member is in full concentration, dripping with sweat: this is a serious, industrious group."
"This wine is a combination of two of my favorite things: Watermark Restaurant -Nashville & Pinot Noir. Amarone is my #1 favorite wine but a very close second is Pinot Noir. It is interesting because they seem to be on the opposite ends of the spectrum. Amarone is bold, thick, rich, earthy, late harvest almost port-like while Pinot Noir is subtle, light, complex. I prefer the barnyard, old world style of Burgundy."

Like many, we also watched a lot of television trying to determine how bad Irene was going to be, and what needed to be done in case of each possible scenario. I can't imagine living far from the coast, but one of the prices of that choice is having to deal with these sorts of events. So you remember what has happened before, do all that you can in preparation for what's to come and hope for the best."

"Last year on the first of June, Dad and my stepmother moved to an assisted living facility just over an hour from my home. It was an excellent move; instantly they were surrounded by caring staff and new friends. They no longer had to haul laundry up and down the (dangerous) basement steps or negotiate icy sidewalks. No danger of him falling from a ladder again, and spending months in rehab (for a time he forgot his own name). No facing months of isolation because of cold temps and those same icy sidewalks. The facility organizes occasional trips for fishing and, at his request, to Dad's favorite casino, along with more sedate activities like bingo and tea time (I have seen my future and it includes jigsaw puzzles). In addition, it was easier for my siblings and I to visit and for Dad and Kay to ""host"" us without having to make special preparations."

When we link to low-content sites from our high-content sites, we are telling Google and everyone that we think that the site we are linking to is in some way authoritative, even if we’re saying they’re dirty scammers. We’re helping their page rank and we’re slowly, infinitesimally almost, decreasing the value of Google and polluting the Internet pool in which we frequently swim. Don’t link to spammers."

"Their second mistake was to release the eight minute long ""This Month's Epic"" as the debut single, launching their career on a very overblown, dramatic flourish which subsequently gained absolutely no airplay, and aggravated the earthy, laddish music press of the time. Although I happen to think ""This Month's Epic"" is actually one of the finest singles issued in the mid-nineties, they perhaps could have waited until they'd slipped into the public's consciousness with something a bit more snappy. After all, they had snappy pop tunes by the bundle - ""Soap Opera"" and ""Desire"" on this album prove that conclusively."

Ask yourself: who gave them the right to judge Israel and find it wanting? Is it the fact that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East (and may return to that status if Iraq does not succeed)? Is their judgment at all connected to their similar judgments about America and her presence in the Middle East? And how do they manage to blind themselves to the presence of Hezbollah in Beirut or Hamas in Palestine? What part of “jihad” do they fail to understand?

I then finely chop the kidneys, liver and tongue, and add them to the pan. I turn the heat up, add the rabbit pieces, and fry until golden and crisp on the outside. Then, the juice and zest of half a lemon, a few sprigs of rosemary, a very healthy glug of white wine, and cover for maybe fifteen minutes. Served with some cavolo nero and crusty bread, it is without doubt the tastiest rabbit dish I have ever cooked. It could probably have fed four; nevertheless we have no problems scoffing the lot, and the bones (and the head, which is still in the fridge) will make for a fine stock tomorrow."

"But languages constantly evolve and I think terms like the ones in Mashable’s list although sometimes ridiculous, show the creativity and humour in language. And in the right context using completely new, colourful and funny language can be very effective. For example humour and a relaxed attitude to language can brighten up dull presentations and make them much more memorable – and personal. I often found the university lectures that were the most engaging and memorable were the ones in which the lecturers didn’t just read out notes written in proper English, but who improvised, used the language as they would do talking normally and who used humour."

Eventually, the introduction of the conditioned stimulus (lovey/music/bedtime routine) will result in a conditioned response (sleep). It worked for Pavlov in getting a dog to drool on command.

"There have always been transvestites. There have always been homosexuals. There have always been pædophiles. In the case of fetishists, be it those who like to dress up in rubber, latex, clothes of the opposite sex, bondage, or whatever, so long as their kinkiness remains in the bedroom and remains between consenting adults of the opposite sex, it doesn't harm anyone. Many men like women to wear high heels as it alters the shape of the calf muscle. Many women find uniforms arousing due to their association with masculine and brave men such as firemen. These could be called fetishes of sorts, but they are harmless. Homosexuality and pædophilia are harmful to everyone involved, and in the case of Mr Rose, his particular quirk has crossed from the realm of the peculiar into that which is dangerous."

"Gadhafi ran Libya's government as a stridently anti-Western dictatorship. British and American military bases were closed in 1970; in the same year the property of Libya's Italian and Jewish communities was confiscated. The ancient Qur'anic law of cutting off the hands of thieves was reinstituted, gambling and alcoholic beverages were outlawed, and all foreign petroleum assets were nationalized (1973). A fervent Arab nationalist, he sought to unify Libya with other Arab countries, including Egypt and Tunisia, while bitterly opposing Israel. Since Gadhafi took power the Libyan government has been known for its support of many international terrorist and guerrilla organizations, including the Irish Republican Army, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and other extremist Arab and Islamic groups."
"We have our passports! In addition to them, we got everything besides the cash back. We had already canceled all but one of the cards ( including, it turns out, one that was not with is, or at least not returned). Thankfully, we had not canceled one of them because of issues getting online access. That means that we also now have access to money. So, while we lost a day under very stressful circumstances, and thus will not be climbing the mountain we came here to climb ( where taichi was invented, by the way), we will be continuing on our way, only marginally worse for wear and with a broadened appreciation of the possible kindness of (Chinese) strangers."

"Will the settlement actually benefit consumers, as the DOJ claims? It's far too early to predict, but that isn't stopping people from trying. Many of the expressions of dismay that greeted the settlement cite fears of less choice and competition, as the level playing field created by uniform pricing is dismantled, and Amazon continues to consolidate its already commanding dominance of the ebook market. Other commenters disagree, with familiar criticism of the publishing industry."

"Speaking or praying in tongues is one of the more controversial gifts of the Holy Spirit (as per, 1Cor. 12 ff) because many see praying in a language you don’t understand as a demeaning of our persons – especially our intellect. After all how can it be prayer at all if you don’t know what you are saying? How can spouting what appears to be a bunch of gibberish be called prayer? This mystery can only be understood if we properly understand that man has been endowed with a capability to transcend the natural – that capability is embedded in what scripture calls the “spirit” of man."

"True, ultimately all authority is derivative from God himself but I fail to see how this establishes a partite kingdom in a Witness sense. God is a unique being, and only he is sovereign over all. Only he is able to rule from heaven over all the earth. Jesus is said to have David’s throne, a rulership which is terrestrial, earthly, though God-given. (Luke 1:32-35)"

"I just had this overwhelming urge to write AU “Unending” fic where Jack got stuck with them in the time dilation. No idea why. It just kind of jumped into my head. Damn those plot bunnies. I’ve got too many of them in there, I don’t need more."
"You are very resilient souls and it seems remarkable to us that you have such a strong sense of survival. Your experiences have been very challenging yet you somehow see your way through. It is that which makes you very respected and admired, as that quality will see you put those experiences to good use when you work with evolving Beings. It is usual for ascended souls like you will shortly be, to seek opportunities to serve others. There are always new civilisations coming along, and the creators never cease bringing more into being. No one quite knows how many there are, and Space with its endless dimensions is teeming with life that goes on into infinity. Indeed the Supreme Creator is forever dreaming new life forms into existence, and these will follow a similar path of evolution to your own."

"Yesterday's photoshoot was laid back fun. We did the whole shoot around the rehearsal studios, mostly outside. Some long exposures and 2 second smiles should lead to at least a handful of shots we can use on the new album liner and around the interweb. We'll post some here once they are back from the lab."
"When I started writing the content on this page in early February, much of my part of the country was under a state of emergency because of severe winter weather.

"Some improvements may be a bigger battery for longer usage time, and more Angry Birds playtime. It also leads to a bigger and better camera sensor with at least a five megapixel CMOS sensor. Also the retina display which is bigger, better, and larger than the iPad 2 display. Rumor is the iPad 3 may be slightly bigger to compensate for the higher resolution screen.

"On May 2, in yet another preliminary parliament session debating the allocation of a 99-strong committee to draft amendments to the constitution, the opposition are objecting the role of the House speaker in this process, as they accuse him to have the power to pre-select 22 non-MP committee candidates (such as academics and NGOs) before the parliament decides on them."

We didn't want him to suffer much longer but definitely needed time to say goodbye. We had less than 24 hours to spend with Fritz and make his last day with us special. He was let back upstairs for the night where he enjoyed time walking on my sofas and cuddling up with me in bed for the night. We picked up extra food and made sure the plate was full through the night.
"Needless to say, this story is terrifying, and an amazing tale of intense courage and unimaginable faith. And it is a crazy read, mainly because Ming videotaped most of his interrogations of Mary and the transcripts are included. The part when Mary is like, ""Wait, you were in my algebra class 15 years ago?"" is pretty surreal. Also, lots of Ming's SUPER WEIRD x-rated fan fiction is included. He had a thing for white underwear and TV moms."
I think I was doing ok with the struggles this time around until Dougal and Glenna were sent to America. I suppose it just didn't seem hopeless until then. At least they still had each other. I wasn't really a fan of the struggles they were still enduring by the end of the book though. I guess I thought they had been through enough and just wanted to read about more of their happiness together.
"My brother Pat is a very outgoing, gregarious person. He is loud and bossy and self-directed. He was my mother’s favorite because of his personality which was much like hers. He is always surrounded by an entourage. He is an entrepreneur. As a child, he frowned frequently in pictures. He has always been stocky and a bit overweight. Today he has diabetes and some health problems. He has a wholesale American southwest and Mexican import business, a tree farm, a Pennsylvanian blue stone quarry business, and owns several apartment buildings in the city where he lives. He has never married though he has had several girlfriends who have had children and he has been extremely good to those children. He is still concerned with two grandchildren of one of his grandchildren who lived with him for most of their growing up years and tries to remain in their lives. He is good to his nieces and nephews. He read a lot and researches quite a bit about the things he sells. He also is interested in fossils and gemstones. He can be a bit difficult but I’m glad he’s my brother."

"I actually had three unpublished books. There was one unpublished adult crime novel, a Lincoln Perry novel, which to me is the first one. And then when I was at high school I wrote two young adult novels, and I count those, even if nobody else does (chuckling), because they showed me how to write books from beginning to end, and that’s a really huge part of the writing process; to just develop the discipline to stick with a story over how many weeks or months. So I’d written three novels, and I was working as a journalist. I’d covered everything from police beat to sports reporting, and about everything in between."

It exists and our two destinies are entwined in its force.
"One of the odd things about the Internet is that so many people don’t seem to understand that it’s real. Sure, they realize that there’s a computer in front of them, a “series of tubes,” and then…it gets kind of foggy.

"My husband gets uptight when we're together. We went to the movies and I sat between my sister and my husband. My husband bought popcorn and I thought I would offer it to my right. As I handed over the bag, my elbow knocked against the arm rest and my hand went numb. I ended up spilling a portion of the bag into my sisters lap at the very same time she was saying ""No thanks."" The movie was starting and we were giggling as she sifted through popcorn in her purse and lap. My husband groaned which tells me he's annoyed by my antics."

Basically, there are only enough tickets for a puny amount of the students, so competition is FIERCE. I'm feeling especially competitive because last year, I was late by about 30 seconds and didn't get any -- I ended up buying them for double the price from a grad student off craigslist.

"N30 and the campaign to date was reviewed by UNISON's Head of Local Government for Wales, Dominic MacAskill. He stressed the historic nature of the action; 30+ unions working together, the numbers on demonstrations, support from the public and the 126% increase in recruitment from the announcement of the ballot to the day of strike action itself. The lesson he drew from this however was that 'we need to be realistic' and that 'we need a negotiated settlement'. We were told that we should therefore welcome the 'Heads of Agreement' as a 'significant advance'.

Soon Savannah is in over her head. She's run off the road and nearly killed, haunted by a mystery stalker and freaked out when the brother of one of the dead women is murdered when he tries to investigate the crime. To complicate things, something weird is happening to her powers. Pitted against shamans, demons, a voodoo-inflected cult and garden-variety goons, Savannah has to fight to ensure her first case isn't her last. And she also has to ask for help, perhaps the hardest lesson she's ever had to learn.
I confided in two friends that, perhaps, I should experiment with my sexuality…I wanted to know what it was like to be with a girl…how it would make me feel. After all, based on my logical take on the world, there were more than a few occasions when I was told that I would “make a GREAT lesbian”…whatever THAT means…

"It is one thing to write a page or two of witty and entertaining dialogue, but quite another to keep the ideas flowing for the duration of a book.

I don’t stake out the nests of birds, don’t bait animals, and try not to disturb any wildlife more than I absolutely have to. OK, so I do check out Mother Goose nearly everyday, but I stick my head up above the berm just enough to see if she’s there or not, then leave. If she hadn’t nested where she had, I would actually walk farther in her direction than what I do, and spend more time there because I have a good view of the pond from that point. In a way, she’s cutting into the photos I could be getting if she hadn’t nested where she did."

"They found that, generally, lemurs kept their lice to themselves, but occasionally, some would donate or collect lice. The actual mechanism by which the donation or collection occurs is not known – it’s not like trading lice is a common mouse lemur pastime, but it is probably linked to close contact via nest-sharing and other aspects of social ecology. Social interactions also increase during the breeding season, when the males are out on the prowl for the lay-deez. There seemed to be no (identifiable) overarching factor driving the movement of lice within the population."

"I was looking around for something to read, bored out of my mind by some Sinclair Lewis novel I downloaded for free from the Gutenberg Project, when I noticed that someone in the house had removed an old Time-Life book from the bookshelf in the dining room so they might employ it as a mousepad for some murderous game played on a laptop while sitting on the couch eating Goldfish and watching Family Guy. That's the level of respect we have for books these days, They're mousepads. These old Time-Life books, a series called ""The Old West"", belonged to my wife's father, and they've done nothing but collect dust since the turn of the century and well before that, I'm sure. And it was not with purposeful disrespect that the person in question decided it made a good mousepad, but a careful study of its smooth, leather-ish exterior determined it had the right reflective properties and gripping strength to be used for something. What are those stupid decorations in the dining room all about? The things with the paper inside them that look like perfect laptop mousepads?"
"Here in Cartmel’s tenure, when the Doctor gives up screen time, it’s primarily given to his Companion, Ace, and in focusing on her we’re often learning about the Doctor, too, either directly or indirectly. Even when we’re not, though, we’re learning about her and since she’s on board this crazy TARDIS ride, too (although the TARDIS set is becoming less frequently used), screen time given to her enriches, rather than detracts, from the program."

If you’ve been in the habit of starting the day with real coffee, with two sugars and milk then switching to decaffeinated coffee with one sweetener and no milk takes more than thirty days of forcing the stuff down your throat until you acquire a taste for it. I speak from experience but that’s how I take my coffee these days. It’s drinkable; I’ve got used to it, but I can’t say that I prefer it; I just acknowledge that it’s better for me, especially considering the number of mugs of coffees I can go through in a day."

"By contrast the brutal Fomorians are out to exploit nature, rather than be a part of it. They had features “hanging like seaweed when the tide is out, their tongues the colour and shape of cormorant tongues, the clamour of the ocean their talk”. Their arrival in Ireland saw ""forests cut down, rivers rerouted, towers everywhere, it was soon clear it must come to a fight.” (P28)."
"Not surprisingly, I approached it exactly like an academic paper. We were asked to blog about TV episodes, and I took it very literally. I actually took notes during the episode to keep track of characters and every plot twist. I wrote about three drafts before I was satisfied, but still had no idea if it was anything remotely close to a blog (of which I had read about 3). But it was not as difficult as I expected it to be, and I realized that I could relax my writing and do without the 3 revisions (which was good, because after the first week, I didn’t have time for that anyway!)."

We are expected to believe Cornelius, Zira, and a new chimp named Milo scurried off after Brent and Nova left them in BTPOTA to the sunken remains of Taylor’s spaceship. In spite of originating from a pre-industrial society, they knew how to repair the ship, get it flying, and somehow caught some sort of wave from Earth’s destruction in order to be thrown back in time to 1973. They managed to get airborne in a manner of a few days at most. Heck, I cannot even figure out how they got the astronaut boots on considering chimps have an opposable toe that could not be crammed into a human boot."

"Meanwhile, I am somehow not only comfortable with all the religious symbols affixed to my car, I am getting a huge creative kick out of recombining them into an optimistic and inclusive art project. The religions theme is subtle, woven through the mosaic, alongside other motifs emerging organically (peace, the cast-off toys from our growing children, art for the sake of art). But though I did not set out with this intention, I see now that my religious interior–complex, colorful, joyous, open to interpretation, simultaneously familiar and incrutable–now has an exterior manifestation, on the hood of my car. If you see my “Bothmobile” at a traffic light, honk for harmony."

The essence of the Gonski report is that all children in every school should receive a base level of funding equivalent to schools in which at least 80 per cent of students achieved above minimum national standard in reading and numeracy across the three years 2008-2010. This is highly aspirational: these are the best-performing schools in Australia.

"A friend of mine who studied child psychology explained that the mind of a child is very delicate, hence the violence witnessed by children in 2008 may manifest later in the years. For example disruptions at grade 2 level can manifest at grade 7 and therefore it is very possible to get a 0% pass rate. It is fact that most of the violence took place in rural communities and it is no surprise that rural schools have the highest levels of failure rates. I do not want to under play other factors contributing to this failure but political violence remains a key factor."

I have a habit of buying new 'stash' and putting it away and then not using it so both of these challenges allowed me to make use of some button brads I bought a few months back in my local TK Maxx store.

"Born February 9, 1974, Paul Carberry has inherited a wealth of riding talent from his father Tommy, who won the 1975 Grand National on L’Escargot. He followed in his father’s footsteps when partnering Bobbyjo, trained by Tommy, to a popular victory in the 1999 Grand National. That success came two years after he lifted the Topham Trophy over the big Aintree fences aboard Joe White. His brother Philip is also a successful rider, while his sister Nina is a leading amateur. Over more than a decade, Carberry has forged a reputation as one of the most stylish jockeys – a talent nurtured through hunting, show jumping and point-to-pointing in Ireland. He rides principally for Noel Meade in Ireland. Carberry was Irish champion in 2001/02 and 2002/03. Nicknamed ‘Alice’ in the weighing room, Carberry is a renowned party person and once suffered a bizarre injury when being head-butted in the stomach by a deer while out hunting. He has been successful aboard numerous high-class horses including Harchibald, Iktitaf, Direct Route, Dorans Pride, Beef Or Salmon, Limestone Lad, Go Native, Looks Like Trouble and Pandorama. He has partnered 12 winners at the Cheltenham Festival. Carberry made the headlines for the wrong reasons in 2006 when he was sentenced to two months imprisonment for setting fire to a newspaper on an Aer Lingus flight, although this was reduced to community service on appeal. In October, 2009, he failed a breath test for alcohol before riding at Naas and was banned from riding for 30 days. He has now resolved not to drink again until his riding career is over and has recorded the highs and lows of his life to date in the autobiography “One Hell Of A Ride”, which was published in October, 2011.

"I was going to make a pumpkin apple pie for Thanksgiving but then I was talking to this random dude about unique pie combinations and allegedly his wife had made a cranberry and jalapeno apple pie. He said she didn’t use a recipe and just came up with the idea one day. I told him that was brilliant and I am stealing it. Rather than throw everything in a bowl and mix it together, I decided to take a more calculated approach. I’m glad I did."

"In the 1932 elections, the Nazi upsurge amounted to 43.5% in the Breslau electoral division, 48% in Liegnitz - both in Lower Silesia - but only 29.2% in Upper Silesia, where the Catholic Centre remained strong. The Communists were also stronger in Upper Silesia than in Lower Silesia, though they only got 17% even there. As the world knows, in 1933, Paul von Hindenburg, the president after whom my mother's birthplace had been renamed, faced with the danger of civil war, decided to invite Adolf Hitler to become Chancellor. That was in January. On 27th February the Reichstag went up in flames, and the purge of the Left began. Communist and Social Democratic politicians were dragged off to 'wild' concentration camps, many of them murdered. Hermann Goering drafted a new law - to reform the civil service. The police came under this law, and my grandfather's career was severely threatened."

"An agreement was reached and an addition was built onto the rear of the grocery and made into a tavern. You may note that I refer to one establishment as a tavern and the other as a saloon. This is not accidental. Gelhausen's was a dark, bad place with men sitting around. I do not know why, when beer was again legal, that Grandma always had me go to Gelhausen's when she wanted a pitcher of beer. There was a side door at the rear and a separate tap for take-out. It cost a whole dime for a big pitcher of beer.

I am going to head out of work a bit early today. My first stop will be the gym (I think I will run to Alanis tonight) and then I need to do my weekly grocery shopping. I know there are many people that like grocery shopping, but not me. I used to like it better, but money is soo tight right now. I don't get to pick new things to try...just keep to the essentials. But things will get better...and I know they could be worse.

Finally, the clothing you wear to bed can affect the quality of sleep you have. Rough fabrics or heavy material can cause irritation that makes it difficult to fall and remain asleep. Wearing fabrics that are comfortable can cure this. One such fabric is nylon. Nylon Nightgowns are light and breathable. They allow free movement and do not hinder natural sleep positions.

''The concern that the Coalition has is that there's an enormous power imbalance in the supply chain, between the big supermarkets and smaller suppliers and where that market dominance is detrimental to suppliers in the longer term, consumers will also be disadvantaged.'' To say there's an enormous power imbalance in the supply chain"" is just the most extraordinarily wild understatement, but it's hard to imagine the Liberal Party actually doing anything about the situation even if they were in government because of their business-friendly attitude and their economic-libertarian tendencies. The National Party would huff and puff but in the end the views of the larger partner in the Coalition would win out. The Labor Party is unlikely to do anything because if it did it would be blamed for any price increases felt by consumers. It would fall to the Greens to support the agricultural sector in Australia, but they are unlikely to lead a majority government for the forseeable future. In coalition with Labor their views would also be smothered. But what can government do, anyway. Probably not much."

"Don't get me wrong, the beer is still wonderful and probably more of a crowd pleaser in the NW than mine would be. The color is gorgeous and the nose is spot-on perfect.

Excellent. Oh, and the label is pretty cool too."

So, when we have an argument with somebody else and we do not forgive him/her, we cannot be ourselves. There is this one thing, that hold us back and we are not natural. When we love somebody we feel joy to be with them, we develop the relationship, we seek for intimacy. It is obvious that un-forgiveness comes in conflict with love, does not promote, develop love."

Each year since, the same group, along with a few close friends and family, have come together to carry on the tradition at the White House.

"While one can take issue with some of the language used – fate of the whole world being one – it is important to understand the scale of the threat, and why there are no easy and quick solutions. The risks from spent fuel have been known almost since the beginning of nuclear power – the radiation levels are so high that without shielding, direct exposure to spent fuel rods is fatal. Despite this knowledge the world proceeded to deploy nuclear power reactors – led by the United States – that has created a total global inventory of over one quarter of million tons. Most of this is stored in water filled pools. In addition to creating a massive plutonium stock – 2500 tons (contained in spent fuel) and compared with the micro-grams that were valued above gold in 1944 by the engineers running the Manhattan project – the spent fuel crisis has spread worldwide to every nation operating nuclear reactors."

After making Light Whole Wheat Baguette I had some dough sitting in the fridge I wanted to use up and I didn't want to make more bread. I had read this dough can be used for pizza dough so I decided to give it a try. I had read on a couple blogs about Mexican Pizza and have been wanting to give try it. My pizza was very light on cheese. I would prefer much more. One time I put a little extra cheese on the pizza and Hasan took a couple of bites and stopped saying he didn't like it. So to make sure he would eat it I went easy on the cheese. He also has another condition that the cheese must be yellow. Once I tried to put mozzarella and he didn't eat it because it wasn't yellow.

It had been nominated for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Picture, Best Writing and Best Song. Because of its musical arrangement and lyrics, great singers like Dionne Warwick, Barbara Streisand, Cher, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan (where I got my name from, as told by my dad),Whitney Houston to name a few have their own renditions of the song."
"Once I have these four points worked out, I can write my story’s synopsis. Sometimes if I find that I am not sure of my character’s pathway to this story or their motivation, I will also use these four points to write a character synopsis. The synopsis does not need to be difficult nor does it need to be put off until the last unavoidable minute before you have to scratch one together in a wild panic. I also find that when I write a synopsis at the beginning of my first draft, it keeps me from hitting a block or stumbling point. Like a map, it gives me a clear path to my final destination. There may still end up being unexpected roadblocks but with just a few minutes looking back at my road map (SYNOPSIS) I am back on track."

So here is the latest stroke of Marxism from Obama and I notice he’s getting much bolder. Imagine how bold he’ll be if he gets 4 more years? I’m sure somewhere along the way he’ll trash our flag and replace it by all those red flags you used to see in the Kremlin Square on May Day. This is no mistake. His “bible” is Saul Alinsky’s book “Rules for Radicals” which is really a book for the New Marxists in this 21st century. I’m actually glad Obama is exposing himself and his true leanings because we now have a better idea where his administration stands and just what the next 4 years might entail. I’ve said it before and will again. Hope you have learned the goose step by now!!

"And the way he just sat down in the midst and behaved like this was his own living room! He was always like this in the temple, like nowhere else. He would lounge about, watching the proceedings. Often he didn’t even preach or minister. Now, the more he relaxed, the more everyone else got on edge. Hopefully he would soon get on with whatever it was he had planned. Several of the Pharisees had gathered and were conferring about something, their eyes like daggers probing Jesus’ position; then one of them left, apparently on some kind of errand. They were always plotting, never anything good. The less time they had, the better. Keep one step ahead, that was the best defence against them. It was a miracle Jesus hadn’t been taken into custody already."

"Vichy France quickly became one of the major manufacturing centers for Nazi war materials, and the French quickly instituted the Nazis policies towards the Jews.

Later, this was extended to many Jews whom had French citizenship."

Much better than the usual Hollywood Blockbuster Adaptation. Coming to the story blind, I thought they did a good job setting up the world and characters. I dug the whole retro-future look of it all. The train ride was cool: ""That is mahogany!"" So, there you have my 10-second review. The Blu-ray should have a lot of great stuff on it."

"I stop mowing. The soft green leaves of the lilac press into my face; the sweet smell that always reminds me of my grandmother envelops me. I close my eyes, breathe deeply, and stand with the lawn mower vibrating in my hands."
"What aspect of church do we expect people to make that connection with? A teacher at heart, it’s my hope that a relevant exposition of the Bible will have some influence. For many, singing in praise to God with the rest of the church provides the connection. But, should people anticipate weekly worship as the most significant time to meet with God? I wouldn’t be surprised if a large percentage of people find their connection with God during small group discussions, while serving others, after making what was learned on Sunday a part of real life during the week, or even during the thought process involved with writing (or reading) a blog."
"I remembered that even when I was younger, I already had an inclination to teach. I loved to talk and give advice; I wanted to be a priest at one point since I thought it would be cool to give ‘unboring’ homilies. Back in grade school, I would often substitute for my teachers whenever they’re absent. In high school, I joined an organization that reached out to public school children. I taught catechism for two years at the Balara Elementary School, and I loved interacting with the kids. And in college, I became a master of listening and reading people.

"I’ve always been pretty good at saving, but it was spending that I needed to work on and I don’t mean that I needed to spend more. After reading some of the Thrifty Chicks' posts, I realized that I wasn’t always fulfilling my thrifty living mantra, not to mention doing my part for the planet. The cheapest option isn’t always the best option. The best option and, therefore, the best use of my money, is the clothing and the wares that are good quality and going to last. Only in the reuse market can you consistently find items that are both good quality and inexpensive."

"In high school I spent a lot of time on the stage. It was a place where I could creep out of my own life and become someone else. It was a place where I could perform. It was a place where I could speak slowly and meaningfully and feel as though I was being heard, listened to, applauded for. It was a place where I could feel brave and passionate and exposed, in the best sort of way. It was a place where I could pretend to be different people. But it was also the place where I discovered who I am."
"For example, we now know that, contrary to claims made when the bill passed, the law will not come close to achieving universal coverage. In fact, as time goes by, it looks as if the bill will cover fewer and fewer people than advertised. According to a report from the Congressional Budget Office released last week, Obamacare will leave 27 million Americans uninsured by 2022. This represents an increase of 2–4 million uninsured over previous reports. Moreover, it should be noted that, of the 23 million Americans who will gain coverage under Obamacare, 17 million will not be covered by real insurance, but will simply be dumped into the Medicaid system, with all its problems of access and quality. Thus, only about 20 million Americans will receive actual insurance coverage under Obamacare. That’s certainly an improvement over the status quo, but it’s also a far cry from universal coverage — and not much bang for the buck, given Obamacare’s ever-rising cost."
"Strangely, neither Kiran nor co-host John Roberts apologized nor even mentioned the apparent slip-up. However, AM executive producer Jamie Kraft apparently noticed: He did not run the story again during the second half of the show.

It’s just that the pay here is so excruciatingly low that everytime I submit an essay I felt like a beggar asking for a small piece of bread.

"Renters should also spend an option charge after which it the lease top quality. The option cost is really a set amount the tenant pays the vendor.

Rent rates tend to be a sum slightly over the common rent, using a a part of those funds heading towards a down payment. new homes."

However if you are serious about playing poker for money and want to develop into a solid player, do not spend too much time at the free tables.

Players act completely different when it comes down to their own money when compared to free games.

I was somewhat disappointed to learn when they took the stage that Sammy Llanas is no longer with them. I had no idea. The band revolves around two main performers, Kurt Neumann and Sammy. It was hard to imagine the band without either of them. Still, Kurt did a nice job of playing mostly some of the band's older tunes but with a couple of more recent ones as well. I've seen them many times in concert and while it was a good show it just simply wasn't the same without Sammy. Hopefully he'll find his way back some day."

"Interesting… Paul used what part of the Bible? He used the Hebrew Scriptures. Paul used the Old Testament to show that Jesus was the Messiah; Yeshua HaMashiach in Hebrew. It’s amazing to me how many churches, pastors, and Christians are willing to throw aside the Hebrew Scriptures calling them outdated or not relevant for today. We see Jesus all through the Old Testament! He’s in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and all the way through the Psalms and into the prophets. Friend, you cannot throw out the Hebrew Scriptures without saying that Jesus is no longer relevant. Some would try to say that there are other paths to God. It is true that all paths do lead to God, but there’s only one path that leads to heaven. Everyone will stand before God, but without Jesus, you will be eternally separated from heaven and God at that meeting."

"And you can't do it alone. For me, it took God, my parents, professionals, a therapist, and some important friends. I was the one doing the hard work. But if I tried to do it by myself, I would have failed over and over again. God held me in the most difficult times of my healing. Whenever I thought I felt the most afraid, the most alone, I would pray and open myself up to His love and grace and realize that He was with me- not only at that moment but also when things were happening in my childhood and that He cried with me. I had my parents by my side- paying my hospital bills, coming to family therapy, hearing what I was willing to stop protecting them from. I had friends and teachers who sent me cards, talked to me on the phone to keep my spirits up, came to visit."

I certainly see this as an opportunity to bring beer closer to the food industry giving scope to match beer in a more appropriate measure with food is an avenue that should be explored."

There is a pattern to Paul’s teaching in today’s reading:
"Having lived and worked in the Caribbean and in different states of the US exposed Aníbal to various environments and lots of people. I wondered if he recommended working abroad to get a different perspective and enhance creativity. His point of view wasn’t what I expected to hear but nonetheless, very logical, “We live connected now, so even if you don’t work abroad you are heavily exposed to global work, to good work (and bad too). You can learn from it even if you haven’t been there. Just have to look for it.” On the other hand, living in different places and having unique experiences makes you “interesting”, which have been stressed by advertising professionals everywhere."

Wrongly assuming his wife had heard the children he did not take any weapon with him. On entering the kitchen he was shot in the left cheek at close range by one of three intruders who confronted him. He put up a fight and was stabbed and shot a second time. The report then states that he managed to free his one daughter from one of the attackers so both girls could get to their Mother in the bedroom which has somewhat sinister implications.

"The further I sink down, the more I feel right beside him, feel how much, in spite of the differences, our ventures came together, in the unthought and the heartrending. The reason for Beckett’s critical silence after the war is perhaps best expressed when he ends a letter about van Velde: “I am no longer capable of writing about.” Such thought, such writing, is mere relation. The contradiction inherent in making such statements cannot go unnoticed: “To write is impossible but yet impossible enough”. There is also a need to speak. To Thomas MacGreevy he writes of his “feeling of helplessness ... and of speechlessness, and of restlessness also I think, before works of art”."

This time round I intend to follow this up by answering a few of the questions I received following this post (and my design you own textbook post)
"It is unmistakably Brautigan. And I’ll be honest a little Brautigan can go a long way; he is like Beckett in that respect. His style is laconic, repetitive and expressed in the simple, straightforward language that poor people living on Welfare in any one of a thousand small towns will use happily turning nouns into verbs whenever it suits their needs. The setting in this book is a succession of dreary towns in Oregon but you could shift the action to Louisiana or South Dakota and not bat an eye."

In the first part of Part V three themes are employed: the journey to
"When I think about the times when I live in the moment. On the allotment, where I often just turn up, whatever mood I'm in, whatever the weather. I don't always know what I'm going to do. I just turn up and start somewhere on the plot... pulling up weeds for example, or planting something, or like last weekend, clearing the paths of weeds, covering them and putting chippings down. Most of the time, I focus on what I'm doing. It's very practical, often repetitive, and involves exertion. I'm conscious of what I'm doing, and whether it's hot, the birds chirruping, the strimmer somewhere on the plot, when the sun goes behind the clouds, whether I'm thirsty or not, how wet or dry the soil is, how it feels to dig the fork into the ground, the smell of the soil. I still think about other things, but the thoughts come and go. Often I can arrive in a bad mood or a tired mood or preoccupied and it works out by the time I finish. I notice what has grown a little more, I notice everything. It's the time when I am most observant of what's around me, but also observant of how I feel in a very uncomplicated way."
"Now, I don’t have children, but my friends who do, speak of “pregnancy amnesia,” the phenomenon in which a mother forgets all the pain and anguish that accompanied her pregnancy so she is willing to go through the process again. I would say that the writer’s journey to publication is a bit like this, because no writer would willingly put themselves through all the torment and pain of rejection if it weren’t for some form of temporary amnesia."

"The counterpoint to Carrie’s passive drift upward is, of course, Hurstwood’s passive drift downward. It may at first glance appear that Hurstwood’s ruin is owing to an overt act — stealing money from his company’s safe — but even that is a kind of drift. He can’t explain it even to himself: it’s like a stranger’s voice in his head."
With this heat?
"Although this is a work of historical fiction there is a certain amount of realism. Fogelström presents a well researched book where actual events are incorporated into the book. One of the things I appreciate about this series is that the characters are never given an important part in the historical events of the time. Rather we see them through their eyes, the eyes of the normal person. That makes the books more real to me. One criticism of sorts is that the main characters are incredibly good. It can get a bit grating at times but at the same time makes an important point of not giving into your circumstances."
"Soldier"" 5:03"
"Harvey's not to every ones taste, and he seems to evoke a 'Marmite' style divide - love him or hate him. Mrs P is interested in a number of comics, but has never warmed to his work (although she did really enjoy the film adaptation of American Splendor a few years back). She finds him just too grouchy and his stories just too mundane... which ironically are the two things I love the most about his stuff! But I guess I see more of myself in Harvey than Mrs P does! On the face of it, his work may not look like anything special... a story about the growing awkwardness of someone giving him a lift to work, a conversation he's overheard in a shop, how a vague acquaintance became a better 'friend in need' than any of his true 'friends' when help was needed.... it's everyday stuff. But scratch beneath the surface and see yourself staring right back. I don't find gold in every story, occasionally one will leave me a bit 'non-plussed' thinking ""and??"" at the end of it. But that's the nature of this particular beast, and no doubt someone somewhere read the same thing and it really spoke to them. I remember reading one of his comics where he was reminiscing about old relationships, how the break-ups had affected him, his thoughts on love and loneliness etc. It was really profound and I kept re-reading it over and over again."

Examining the Structure
"In the Rwandan genocides of 1994, more than 800,000 people were killed in a matter of weeks; that is roughly the population of San Francisco or Austin, TX. Roughly 400,000 people have died in the Sudan in the last few years as a result of deplorable living conditions brought on by a civil war; that is roughly the population of Miami, Cleveland, or Tulsa. In the ""War on Terror"" in Iraq and Afghanistan, reliable estimates put the total death toll at somewhere around 919,967, which includes 5,885 US service members; this is roughly the population of San Jose, CA, or Indianapolis. The wars in the Balkans in the early 90s caused deaths equal to the population of Cincinnati. Combined, these deaths of just these few wars would equal the population of Chicago."
"If you have time I would also recommend a day trip up to Shenzhen. I guess the first thing to note is that it’s a fun place but not for the scenery. A city on the border of HK in China, it’s basically the retail outlet for the whole of the Pearl River Delta - the manufacturing hub of China. Anything you buy that says ‘made in china’ which, ahem, is just about everything, probably comes from somewhere in the PRD. Catch the East Rail Line and it takes about an hour. Shenzhen is over the border at Lo Wu, the very last stop on the line. You will have to get a visa for the Shenzhen Economic Zone at the entry point (if you don't already have a China visa) and go through immigration - but it’s pretty straightforward. Make sure you check whether you are allowed to get a visa, I think it depends on your country of origin – I know Australia and NZ citizens are allowed but I think it’s more difficult for other countries such as the US. These things change often so check before you go."

"A long, low, moss and lichen encrusted concrete structure appears ahead. Letting my imagination run wild, it could be a remnant of a military installation from the Cold War, or part of a launch structure from the early days of the space race. But, more mundanely, it is actually the ’56 Gates’, a row of sluices built in 1947 to allow waters to be diverted onto an area of floodplain rather than valuable agricultural land in times of inundation."
Sure he did. Whatever.
"Also slightly hilarious for me is the complete omission of Sevilla (and I can’t remember if Gary has been or not). I lived with an American last year who was obsessed with this city and would not shut up about it–to the point I got really turned off by the city simply because I was forced to hear so much about it (which I suppose isn’t fair, but oh well). I’ve been to Sevilla a few times and while I liked it, it’s not one of my favorite places in Spain. Good to see Gary and the people who helped him compile the list agree with me!"

"Ever since I’ve been a little boy I’ve always wondered what would happen when I died. It might be a little morbid, but I can remember in primary school ‘If I die, it’s like going to sleep but never waking up.’ And as hard as I tried to imagine that, it simply didn’t make sense. I couldn’t accept that it just ‘ended’ like that. Surely, I thought, there had to be something more."

I so want my rational brain to be able to justify healing work, and it can’t. I grew up having to justify everything rationally, being unaware of my feelings."

"Imagine if an blameless person is proven to be guilty? Obviously, to be seen as responsible, the court has to discover that one has committed an offense. But one needs an attorney to repeatedly point out to the judge who is aiming to punish the person about his innocence. You will require another person working for you, a lawyer who can literally devote all his options to guard your legal rights. That equally consists of the right to a reputable defense, and also the right which guarantees a fast litigation. You also have the right to address any witnesses who is against you. There are actually a lot of various other rights and only a legal professional can teach you about these. The main component when selecting a lawyer is that essentially there exists an individual dependable doing work for your best needs."

I doubt I'll shed new light on it for you but some of the responses I've received have caused me to further contemplate.
"Advice From Dave: Great talk last night, all about the spiritual aspects of the juice feast. Dave is on another spiritual path from me: I am Christian, whereas he talks about the chakras and the kundilindi and the Life Force. But what we have in common is this: we are both acutely aware that we are SPIRITUAL beings, having a HUMAN experience, not just human beings having a spiritual experience. Whatever your spiritual path, a juice feast will help you go deeper. When you clear away the excess, and all the mind-numbing compounds even in the healthiest of foods (think of the content lazy fog we get in after an excellent meal) you are left with the essence of you, your spirit. You can take advantage of this time to release what is no longer serving you. Let go of fears, resentments, old baggage. Change how you think about yourself and the possibilities for your life. Press the reset button on your LIFE, not just your digestion. Like a caterpillar, go into this cocoon of your juice feast, use this time for transformation, and come out a beautiful butterfly, ready to spread her wings and fly to a new possibility."

"4.) RESEARCH BEFORE DOING THE MOBILE ASSIGNMENT- The mobile assignment wasn’t tough, but many people were freaking out about it because they were afraid they wouldn’t be able to find an on-campus event to cover. What helped me out a lot was logging onto Mizzou’s event calendar and seeing what exhibits would be up at which places, which club would be holding which sale, etc. Also, remember to utilize Speaker’s Circle, Memorial Union and the Student Center-there’s usually always SOMETHING going on at these places. Remember, the event doesn’t necessarily need to be interesting-it just needs to be an event for you to complete your mobile assignment on time!"
"“I won’t be doing any more big gallery shows for a while, it’s all a bit dodgy. I’ve come into contact with a lot more villains since I moved from vandalism into selling paintings. The art world is full of shady people peddling bright colours. Anti-graffiti groups like to say tagging intimidates people, but not as much as modern art. That stuff is deliberately designed to make normal people feel stupid. I could try and get more legitimate mural work, but scaling a drainpipe is still probably a lot easier than getting an original idea past a committee.”"

Once you get the hang out jotting it all down you'll be more inclined to stick with your list and the impulse buys will reduce considerably.

From swatching the other shades in store, they were pretty pigmented – much more so than Gumdrop, which was one of the sheerest. However, if Gumdrop is any indication, staying power will be an issue, so you will need to reapply often throughout the day."

I was about to say, not particularly inspiring, but then I realised that I have used bits of the town, the cafes, shops, the streets, the parks, river, houses, etc. etc. in my books. My latest, This Is Not Forgiveness, is set in a town very like it, not exactly the same, of course, I would find that too restricting, but not dissimilar. It's an unexceptional town, where ordinary people live, so if you are writing a book about ordinary people, I guess it helps to live and write about somewhere that is easily recognisable, ubiquitous even. That's what I tell myself, anyway."

"Italian food is one of the most democratic food in the world. One can always find an Italian eatery or restaurant in almost every continent. Italian recipes ar considered to be extremely flavorful on with a wonderful aroma that enhances the flavor of the food. Usage of flavorful and rich ingredients such as cheese, tomatoes and olive oil is common in most Italian recipes. Staples include wheat and semolina flour in the form of various types of pastas and breads. The most famous of all Italian foods ar the pizza and pasta recipes, that have secured a high place in the global cuisine as well. The high popularity of such dishes has also influenced neighboring cuisines such as the American and European cuisine as well."
"Often times when students write “academically,” add in a few extra fancy words, or try to change their style completely, the essay is tough to read. The flow of the paper gets muddled and worse the point you are trying to make gets lost in the chaos. Writing according to your style really helps the natural flow of your paper, which in turn helps the reader better understand your message behind the paper. The clarity of your paper is worth so much more than what little authority a few extra words would provide!"

"It doesn’t have to be this way. The destruction can be stopped and we must stop it. Clearly, the river, the land, indigenous humans, and so much more life, are the victims of an abusive system. Like all perpetrators, the way to stop them is to aim at the root of the problem and remove or block their ability to abuse. Basically, the goal is to return the circumstances to the way they were before the abuse started, with the victims free and safe. The abuse of civilization has been a campaign of 10,000 years, so obviously there is much to be done to stop it. But, what choice do we have other than to start now and try?"

I've been thinking a lot about motivation lately. I've got dreams (some big and some small) and my motivations are what I use to propel me towards attaining them.

For that alone I am grateful!

"Artwork: 4.3/5 - As you read the manga, we see that Sakisaka Io has made subtle changes in her style. The characters definitely become more good-looking and harbours a fluffy feel. I must say that her monochrome pages are more appealing compared to her colour pages (typical of manga artists). Sakisaka-sensei’s artwork is very recognizable and I have grown to love it more and more. The scenes are laid-out so well which enhances the touching and cute sensation the manga delivers."

"West, which is situated almost halfway between Austin and Dallas, is a hamlet for the descendants of Czech immigrants—it’s the “Czech Heritage Capital of Texas.” And what you’ll find there is one of the tastiest pastries ever made—the kolache. This sweet, soft, yeasty roll filled with either apricots, prunes, cheese, poppy seeds or sausage is always an excellent excuse to stop the car, stretch your legs and chow down. Everyone in the state loves kolaches, and while you can sometimes find them in the big cities, for some reason they just taste better in West. Perhaps it’s the water, or perhaps it’s the history, or perhaps it’s the competition between all those Czech bakeries serving their interpretation of the same treat, but most will agree that if you want the best kolaches, you must travel to West."
"The first concert was to take place that evening, January 28. “To-night the ‘lights’ have it,” commented Dwight. “A programme light indeed!

But we are glad to see that good overtures and parts of symphonies are not excluded.” He anticipated that the “lights” would outnumber “the rival party” at upcoming concerts, and that the Germanians’ revised plan would “test effectually the relative strength of parties in this matter.”"

We watched sky-divers make a dramatic descent to earth, putting all their faith in a thin piece of silk and a few ropes. We saw people watching from the safety of their hotel rooms behind us.

"The Soul Thief by Cecelia Holland – The Soul Thief is an adventurous look at a turning point in Northern European history. Christianity is the chosen religion of most, but a few still look to the old pagan gods.

This book is the first in a five book series. Recommended by Kimberly S."

"Guy Pearce is a punching bag. He is a man without a past, able to negotiate with or win against authority. This lanky figure, under the shadows of independent cinema, portrays movies’ masculine myths, sleuth, cowboy, king, explorer, diver, fishing on both good and evil. He says your insecurities loud enough for you to hear. I referenced at least five of his movies but he relives them all in the Luc Besson-incepted and Stephen St. Leger and James Mather-directed sci-fi Lockout, a movie set in 2079, while wearing a women’s sized medium graphic tee to expose his veiny biceps, telling audiences he’s not too old to play the Hollywood game of Commonwealth actors working out on the gym to get leading roles. He’s passable as a sellout but let’s be honest, he bagged this role because Hugh Jackman was busy and Pearce wants to buy a condo and put kids through college."

When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment: about sin, because people do not believe in me; about righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; and about judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned."
"An updated version of the 1997 suit, filed with the US District Court of DC in 2006, alleges that promotions at the agency were decided by a “good old boys network” that kept black agents out of top jobs. And “good old boys” isn’t a metaphor — in the Eighties and Nineties, white agents actually joined other government employees an annual event called the “Good Ol’ Boys Roundup,” where they participated in activities like “the posting of racist signs like ‘Nigger check point,’ a simulated lynching of a black man from a tree, and a host of racist skits and songs.” The Roundup also elected a “Redneck of the Year,” a dubious title held by at least one Secret Service agent. And it was apparently a networking and professional development opportunity — many Roundup attendees were later promoted to senior positions with the agency."

"1 The New York Times on Philippines overtaking India as the world’s top call centre. Americans calling the customer service lines of their airlines, phone companies and banks are now more likely to speak to Mark in Manila than Bharat in Bangalore. Over the last several years, a quiet revolution has been reshaping the call center business: the rise of the Philippines, a former US colony that has a large population of young people who speak lightly accented English and, unlike many Indians, are steeped in American culture. More Filipinos — about 400,000 — than Indians now spend their nights talking to mostly American consumers. The jobs have come from the US, Europe and, to some extent, India as outsourcers followed their clients to the Philippines. India, where offshore call centers first took off in a big way, fields as many as 350,000 call center agents, according to some industry estimates. The Philippines, which has a population one-tenth as big as India’s, overtook India this year, according to Jojo Uligan, executive director of the Contact Center Association of the Philippines. The growing preference for the Philippines reflects in part the maturation of the outsourcing business and in part a preference for American English. In the early days, the industry focused simply on finding and setting up shop in countries with large English-speaking populations and low labour costs, which mostly led them to India. But executives say they are now increasingly identifying places best suited for specific tasks. India remains the biggest destination by far for software outsourcing."

Your healthcare dollars at work: If the outside wrapping has been broken, but the individual wrapping is still unbroken/sanitary, the supply cannot be used. If it’s last year’s model, out it goes. Partners in World Health is basically a huge warehouse in Scarborough, ME, run by an RN who knows her stuff, and she has enlisted other RNs to collect all this stuff that would otherwise go into a landfill. She gets it sorted and inventoried, and recycles it to other countries via volunteers who agree to take it. Hey, it’s not as though healthcare were pricey in our country, or anything,"

That’s why he bullies. He’s mean.” Human beings are far more complex that that, and Bull was very real to me. So was Victor and his heartbreaking pain.

"Martello towers are named after the Torre di Mortella in Corsica and were built along England’s southern and eastern coasts between 1804 and 1812, as part of the country’s defences against a possible French invasion. They are extremely solid brick buildings, with outer walls up to 13 feet thick and roofs at least 10 feet in thickness. They are elliptical on the outside with round interiors, meaning that the outer walls vary in thickness, and the thickest walls, in the narrow ends of the ellipse, face the sea. There were very few windows and the entrance was on an upper level, reached either by a retractable ladder or a drawbridge. Inside, a garrison of up to 24 men and officers lived and waited to train their cannon on approaching enemy shipping. In the event, the towers were not tested by a French invasion, but some 47 of them remain, rendered obsolete by advances in both armour and artillery, as reminders of an age gone by."

"For me, Jaws is one of the few movies that lived up to all the hype…and then some. We’ve all gotten amped-up to see uber-promoted blockbusters only to walk out of the theater thinking, “So what?” But Jaws was everything I hoped it would be: scary, funny, surprising. It was not the shocking gore-fest Mom feared - only five people are actually killed - and the poor little pooch she was so worried about doesn‘t die onscreen…in fact, it’s only implied that he dies. There is that jolting scene of one victim’s head popping at the screen with an eye missing, which scared me so bad my popcorn went flying, but Jaws was always more than just a “gotcha” horror movie. Leaving the theater, I felt like I saw just something special, more than just another flick my parents dropped me off to see while they went shopping. In ensuing years, not too many movies gave me that same rush. Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Escape from New York (I’ll explain that last one later) immediately come-to-mind, and the last movie to hit me with the impact of Jaws was Pulp Fiction."

"Another important bit of background information to grapple with for a novice is the idea that planets get in different moods depending on what houses they own. So you can have a benefic in a really “bad mood” if they own difficult houses in the chart. Visa versa, you can have a malefic in a very “good mood”. For example when Capricorn rises, Jupiter owns a “bad house” (the 12th), and this puts him in a “bad mood”. Jupiter is always a gentle and benefic planet, but for some rising signs he is in better moods then others."

A high-pitched whine began to be heard emanating from the cannons and when the sound peaked, the two began blazing away literally blowing everything they hit into tiny pieces. They even swept the building my little group was hiding behind and within seconds, it was reduced to rumble. Only a five-foot length of the back wall remained for us to hide behind."
"What about people’s names? Can they give a clue as to ethnic or racial identities within the plebe? It’s difficult to say. There are certainly many indigenous surnames that occur in the mass of no-category people. Name like Toapanta, Quilago, Cañar, Tituaña, Tutungilla, Lema, Topan, Guamansara, and many others frequently appear without category. It’s just a guess though. In the 1740s, tributaries were still often listed by name, and most Indian tributaries by then already had fully hispanized names."

In the eyes of your geologists and atmospheric scientists, the latest geological indices seem to point to the potential for worldwide catastrophe, but such is not the case. Mother Earth is indeed drastically altering her weather patterns by changing the jet streams that create the global climate; also, unusual heating and cooling states are changing the very nature of the Conveyor Belt that mixes the waters of your oceans, and this too influences your weather patterns. However, this is part of a positive process that will eventually bring together the waters and atmosphere of the surface with those of Inner Earth."

As a pre-emptive strike, I’m going to point out that the gene added to the wheat occurs naturally in many species of plant. It is not, as has been said, a ‘cow gene’."
"Oh, and the #$%^ing garbage men. Wednesday is our scheduled pick up day. I called on Tuesday to inform them that we *still* didn't have our garbage can (the whole neighborhood has the same one). They assured me I could put out bags of trash this once and they would pick them up. So, I lugged everything out on Wednesday morning and went to work. Wednesday night... the damn trash is still there. I called Thursday morning and they claimed I didn't have it out early enough but they would accommodate my ""mistake"" and make another trip on Thursday to pick it up."

"In slower turn’s power oversteer or corner entry understeer is evident, but the downforce soon makes itself felt in the higher gears. The laps of Spa made Eau Rouge and Pouhon easier than you’d expect, but I’d doubt I’d be brave enough to attempt these turns in 6th gear in a real F1 car. In fact the biggest problem of Eau Rouge was lining up the car coming down from La source, with a grass kerb to the left of the track and no visibility of the front wheels on the Simulator. Placing the car was a problem, and although most likely still a problem in a real f1 car, was mainly a downside I’d associate with the simulator. My bad line into Eau Rouge (once I’d stopped trying to take it in top gear in the Megane) was the reason and place for my most spectacular spins. Indeed with the simulator you really don’t want to be hitting the barriers, the hard jolt the platform delivers reminds the driver they have crashed, this is no soft ride."

The impossibility of desire for an image--the ghostly obsession of Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo for the 'nonexistent' Madeline, or the town of Twin Peaks for Laura Palmer; or the inevitable pull of the devouring anima, her reproaches and condemnation as inescapable as death itself, as with the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute, or the ghost vengeance of a Jess Franco nymphomaniacal heroine like Maria Rohm in Venus in Furs.

What is a less likely combination? Events/distances with disparate training make it unlikely that you will set PRs. It is unlikely that you will set mile and marathon PRs on the same training program. It is doubtful that you will train for an Ironman and set Sprint triathlon PRs together. If you do PRs in these disparate events it’s most likely because you never run one distance or the other enough to have been your best at it.

"Now, before you run off and buy some polarizing filters, ask yourself what kind of photography you’re doing. These were important early purchases for me because the vast majority of my photography is done outdoors in settings that tend to have very strong, very direct sunlight. Architecture, travel, walk-around or “street” photography, landscapes. I also tend to travel near, around, or on oceans, where polarized light can reflect off of sand and water and give your shots a really pervasive and aggravating “hazy” look. Polarizers can help cut down on that."

"Ging Kalpapruek in Siam Paragon is the first restaurant we went in Bangkok. We decided to go to Siam Paragon Bangkok, which is an upscale shopping mall and one of the biggest shopping centers in Asia, because we didn’t have the time to research where to go, and I thought that going to Siam Paragon would be the easiest as many restaurants would be in one floor and we would have many choices. We also got to check out this beautiful shopping mall. There was an ample choice of restaurants at Siam Paragon in Bangkok and you will enjoy browsing. There were a ton of people even on Tuesday night, the area was very lively and the food court and restaurant section had so many food stalls and it was like a food amusement park. Ging Kalpapruek is a Thai restaurant which offers variety of Thai food and we all enjoyed our meal."

And it can't be to do with age, because surely a teenager would have if anything a greater need for pace than a middle-aged person? Are we just too busy nowadays to read slowly?

I had my first booth in 2001 and grew from there. I feel proud to look at my humble beginnings (10x10 booth with one book and one shirt) to the MCP mega store that I ended on in 2009 (10x20 booth with 40 shirts, 18 books, prints, buckles, stickers, DVDs, CDs, and more).

"The campaign, some argue, did more to hurt the music industry than to help it. The RIAA claims that 35% of people knew that downloading music for free was illegal prior to their campaign. They also claim that since then the number has risen to 70%. Knowing that free music downloading is illegal does not deter the majority from doing so. And the rising popularity of BitTorrent clients and programs like Retroshare increased illegal downloads exponentially, making not only entire albums available to download with one click, but an artist’s entire discography! There is some debate about whether or not illegal downloading hurts an artist nearly as much as it hurts their label. Artists make the majority of their money through concerts and merchandise. And anyway–how many of the artists you listen to now, whose concerts you have attended and t-shirts you’ve purchased–would you perhaps never even bothered with had their music not been available for free online?"

The very first time I tried to dye something was around 1980 and I was living in Hoboken. I got some turquoise procion dye in a little packet from Pearl Paint in Manhattan. It came with it’s own little bit of soda ash. It all seemed so complicated. I wanted to try batik. I melted some beeswax and painted this giant sheet. I think I painted a huge unicorn or something on it. Anyway I filled a small garbage can with dye and soda ash and water and put the sheet in. Then I left it there for like six weeks. I just didn’t know what to do with it. Everyday I would walk by it in the kitchen and have that same anxious feeling I just told you about. So one day I started to wring it out in the bathtub and turquoise was everywhere. Oh my god I was making a huge mess! I got a big old black garbage bag and threw the whole thing out. I was turquoise up to my elbows and very sad.

The Thunder are one of the NBA’s trendiest teams and it is becoming time for them to shed the youth factor as an excuse for not winning. The Thunder made it all the way to the Western Conference Finals last season only to lose to the eventual NBA champions. This season they are returning all their major pieces including Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. This will be the team’s first season with Kendrick Perkins manning the center spot for a full year and there is no reason not to expect them back toward the top of the Western Conference.

"This is a grant of rights and a non-competition clause all in one, and authors need to think carefully before agreeing to it.

KDP Select goes much farther: it makes Amazon, in effect, your publisher while your book is included in the program, and potentially has an impact on other work you are or are planning to publish.

"I’ve always struggled with people, particularly at school, trying to make me into something that I’m not – namely, an extrovert.

I can still remember the feeling of mortification when my pushy, but well meaning, support teacher was trying to encourage me (openly) to answer questions in class. Even when I didn’t really know the answer! It felt like a mountain to climb every time, and I had to psyche myself up to answer a question. That isn’t to say that I didn’t have friends or wasn’t curious about other people and didn’t want to get to know other people.

"As ___ and I have talked about dating (and been confirmed by what I’ve been reading), we’re not fans of it. I can vouch all too well that it leads to physical intimacy before its appropriate time and that can lead to all kinds of long term problems emotionally (at the very least). But it’s more than just that. Even if two people stay physical apart completely, there is the emotional and spiritual involvement, which is no less dangerous than the physical. My hope and desire is to talk with (her children) openly about the emotions that are involved in “dating”. As obvious the dangers are in physical intimacy before marriage, the dangers of emotional intimacy are no less significant or long lasting."

"In truth, for the most part, the sex-offender registry isn't an issue that breaks down along partisan lines because one of its primary purposes - even more so, IMO, than it promotes public safety - is to allow politicians of all stripes to grandstand and engage in demagoguery, at least until reality intervenes, either through stories of injustice or fiscal contraction. In times of normal budgets, at least for the last coupla decades, everybody on both sides of the aisle has said basically the same thing as the Congresswoman, just like everybody in Salem was against witches. In the current budget environment, though, she's writing checks up there in Washington that the state of Texas can't afford to cash.

"So how can we attract a healthy chunk of the good fortune that floats through the atmosphere? Listen to Machiavelli and Professor Wiseman, Paul Allen and Bill Gates. Once you know in your gut that your product, service or idea has good potential to find a client base, trust your instincts and vigorously pursue and promote what you’ve got. Work hard and be ready when the good fortune rolls around, as Machiavelli advised his patron Lorenzo de’Medici. Most of all, take off the blinders and see the gold nuggets that may lie within your reach, as Wiseman’s study demonstrated.

"Writing is what keeps me sane. The deepest truth in me is that I am one of those artists. Emotionally self-destructive, violently moody and filled with intense, quiet, simmering anger. If you have read my work, you’d see all that and more live in my characters. In fact, the characters in my body of work are defined by the sexualized violence they wield as both sword and shield, their emotional tremors and their desperate grasping at a hope that continually slips further away."

"Let me be more clear, imagine being at that Johns opening (let’s just assume we all know what is going on at all times) and being used to the existential planes of the Ab Ex, playing out their human dramas before us mixed with a lot of super-formalist rhetoric. Suddenly you see a simple symbol of a flag in the gallery, actually not a symbol but a constructed symbol that covers the entire canvas. You would be tempted to think (under the circumstances) that Johns is playing a joke on all representation by showing that everything is in fact a representation, that your symbols are just that, just symbols. Again, the flag is the canvas, the canvas is the flag. It is not a picture of a flag, it is somewhere between a picture and an object."

"All Saints, to you who were not raised Catholics, originated with Pope Boniface IV, who instigated the idea in the early 7th century when he consecrated the Pantheon in Rome as a church dedicated to Saint Mary and the Martyrs, and ordered that that date, May 13, should be celebrated every year. Several centuries later, Pope Urban IV (d. 1264), ordered it to be a day specially to honour those saints who didn't have a festival day of their own."

"do dangerous. Smart, über-careful, ordinary Samantha-that's me. But I just couldn't pass up a surprise kiss from my number-one unattainable crush. A kiss that did something to me...something strange. Now I feel hungry all the time, but not for food. It's like part of me is missing-and I don't know if I can get it back. Then there's Bishop. At first I thought he was just a street kid, but the secrets he's keeping are as intense as his unearthly blue eyes. If he's what I think he is, he may be the only one who can help me. But something terrifying is closing in, and the one chance Bishop and I have to stop it means losing everything I ever wanted and embracing the darkness inside me.... NIGHTWATCHERS When angels and demons must work together,"
"He alone is my Reward! I must fight to maintain an intimate, growing relationship with Him. I must fight to keep the things I love the most from becoming idols in my heart (to the point of being elevated in admiration or affection above Christ)."

"This year, I am implementing aerobics in my gym class. I plan on teaching students how to take their heart rate and calculate their BMI. I think it's imperative for kids to know just how important keeping active is. It's recommended that kids (and teens) get at least 20 minutes of good aerobic exercise 3 times a week. While searching online for some resources, I found many videos that I can use to show my students before they learn their own routine."
"Most people view the world of social networking as the ultimate time suck. While this may be true for some (I am, admittedly, a Twitter addict), social networking can also prove to be useful in forging friendships and comrades-in-writing-arms that can help to make even the most difficult parts of the writing journey shine."

"I always loved the New Year holiday. Not so much the partying on New Year's Eve ( I always, except for one very memorable year, found New Year's Eve to be something of a let down...a time of trying too much to have fun....I guess I like my fun more organic), but the chance to start again, to start fresh. It's the same thrill I get opening a new journal or notebook and thinking about how I'm going to fill it."
"I worked all last week, with Sunday off, then I was supposed to work another 5 days straight. Thursday, I got up and could barely move. I really need two days off to re cooperate with this fibro and back problem. So, I called in and went back to bed, which was all I could physically do."
"He thanked me for telling him these things and wandered away. I saw him later sitting on one of the back seats, watching the leaders in the room. Which made me feel better about what I did. I would like to think that I may have helped someone perhaps stay in the scene, as opposed to never understanding why everyone is ""snobby"" and leaves to go salsa or grow bonsai or something else other than tango."
"I do spend an hour or two every Thursday night gathering the next weeks worksheets, and writing down a “lesson plan”, and picking out crafts, and planning a field trip. Since the A Beka Books comes with a schedule of sorts, its been pretty easy so far. Even for someone with no Home School experience what so ever."
"For our discussions in my small group these last weeks I asked them to read two chapters out of The Brothers Karamazov (“Rebellion and “The Grand Inquisitor”). As I reread “Rebellion” the line that struck me the most was when Ivan said, “One cannot live by rebellion, and I want to live!” I feel a similar disappointment with Dostoevsky’s novel as I do with Foer’s. Ivan doesn’t learn how to live in any way that isn’t rebellion. At the end of the book he’s sick with it."
This particular image was recently a submission in the EditMe challenge I take part in each week and had some fabulous edits. This edited version was what I came up with.
"Usually around 1pm everyday I am ready to hear other people talking instead of just silence or music, so I turn on The Talk. I can't handle The View, but The Talk is definitely bearable. While I don't always get to actually WATCH, it's nice to listen. However, whenever I do look up- the same thing always catches my attention. Sara Gilbert's gold bar necklace. Have y'all ever noticed it? She wears it almost daily and with everything! I am always on the hunt for a necklace that I can wear daily. It is personalized(I am not sure what her's has on it) and I would love either ""M & L"" or ""Ps 62""(my favorite psalm). I may do some hunting on Etsy!"
"So . . . the Christmas weekend is here!! Are you excited? MP let slip (he loves that!) that he has a couple of presents to put under the tree, and I'm all flustered in my eagerness for the fun morning to get here. Presents! I don't know about you, but I love wrapped things. I'm not one for big presents at all--I enjoy my Christmas best when the gifts are laid back and whimsical--but I certainly love ripping into things. And I wonder what he'll think about his gift!"

"Our poor master bathroom has needed an update for awhile now, we finally saved up and decided to give it a little help. For some strange reason, there was carpet in there under the sinks. I don't know why anyone would want carpet in your bathroom! First off, we ripped out the carpet and put tile down. We found an awesome tile guy that was super reasonable and a very nice kid. He did an awesome job! He tiled our counter top, floors, and around our bathtub. Then we painted the cabinet a chocolate brown and got new sinks and brushed nickel faucets. We got a new light above the sinks at Lowe's and we framed out our mirror with some white molding. I love the way it updated our mirror. My hubby put a new rain shower in and a new shower faucet. I panited the walls a really nice gray/khaki color. I went to the ""oops"" paint section at Home Depot and got it for $5.00! We put in new baseboards and painted all the molding. We did all the work ourselves except for the tile. We did have a dear friend help us with the baseboards. Other then that, it was all us! We love Our new bathroom! Now off to the kitchen..."

"So it brings me to tell you the happy part first. Last year, I met a man. Well, technically I’d already met him before, but I guess last year was when I really saw him or shall I say when we really saw each other. A whirlwind year, with a beautiful story which culminated in -We are engaged! Whoop!"

"So imagine yourself driving down a city street at about 2 mph with repeated stops, often trying not to block intersections when the light is green. Pedestrians at crosswalks are weaving through traffic to cross the roads at the walk signals. The oncoming traffic on the coned side of the road is equally backed-up. Then the car in front of you stops. The left indicator of the car is on showing the driver’s intent to turn into a business driveway on the other side of the street. This is going to take place over a double yellow line, stopping two or three lanes of slow oncoming traffic, including one lane which is coned, and eventually crossing a sidewalk during quitting time. It might also be a little dark and/or near a school zone."
"Don't worry...No koalas have been harmed during my bento making process ;). Do you know that koalas are not only grey but there are some white ones too even though they're quite rare ? I wanted to make another koala-themed bento because I really like my first koala bento. I thought about using quail eggs and colouring them grey (but I really didn't know (and still don't know) how to get grey-coloured eggs), but then I remembered that not all koalas are grey, there are white ones too, how convenient, in the end I didn't even have to colour anything:). I decided to use mini mozzarella cheese instead of quail eggs to make the two mini white koalas, because I like the idea of eating pilaf with mozzarella. These mozzarella koalas are made out of: mozarella cheese, nori for eyes, black olive for the nose and chili sauce for the rosy cheeks."

"The context in which the revolution took place would be a pretty good place to start. Up to the 1930s, Spain was a largely preindustrial country controlled by wealthy landowners, the Catholic Church, and a series of monarchs and military dictators. Meanwhile, revolutionary fervor was brewing. Through the turn of the 20th century anarcho-syndicalism grew popular in rural Spain, and to a lesser extent in cities as well. The industrial sector was particularly rife with labor conflict. Strikes were a regular occurrence, and were often violently broken. Many thousands of workers were jailed or killed in numerous strike-busting clashes with bosses, police, and the military. In"

"Actually, I did do a good bit of reading, it was just kind of different than what I usually do. My son's online course is an English course called, ""The Journey."" The readings were a really interesting collection, everything from poetry by Robert Frost, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Mary Oliver, to articles by Steven Covey, to a section of Helen Keller's Autobiography, and a section of KAFFIR BOY. There were also about ten short stories- ""The Necklace"" by Guy Mauipassaunt, “The Silver Mine” by Selma Lagerlof, How Much Land Does a Man Need? by Tolstoy, and ""The Bet"" by Chekhov."

"While considering the recording of history and its housing in vessels, there are also containers that do hot hoard. Indeed, not all conveyance chambers are meant to be storehouses. A camera is simply an instrument for the exposure of images; the purpose of the chamber (“camera,” in Latin) is to facilitate the creation of imagery, rather than its archival storage. Further still, consider the radio: receiving and transmitting signals for our minds’ interpretive abilities, it does not compile or stash away voices, events, or documentation. I listen to today’s news on an antique radio. Occasionally I wonder at its past years of songs, baseball games, and variety shows- from long before my birth. The radio cannot remember; its speaker conveys only what is broadcasting now. But the soul recollects and can identify meaning to its received coordinates. We hold great treasure, albeit as earthen vessels. Is there a limit as to how much the human vessel can hold? I like to think the archive of the soul has an unlimited capacity, providing it is well organized and maintained. Even with that in mind, there must always be an ability to receive and convey without stockpiling."
"Except in the case of the World Wars, conscription throughout American history has proven to be highly unpopular and largely ineffective and unnecessary.

He does things self consciously that brings about either failure or downfall of some kind. he no longer cares about getting to work on time. He will never care about that unless there is some girl there that grabs his interest and he wants to talk to her. He has NEVER wanted to be gung ho about supporting us for me.

"Futures arise from national destinies. In the post-destiny world, there is no future and no past, only a slow decline and decay into a nothingness without shape, substance or form. A nation unmoored from its past has nowhere to go. It cannot make anything new, because there are no new things. Its horizons are limited to its geometry, it experiments with shapes and colors, it digs through the trash of earlier eras for things it can use, reviving trends, dumpster diving through history while feeling that other eras were more exciting and more interesting than this."

"I’ve been on a video game kick lately, ever since went to the Sony Centre to see some classic Final Fantasy music performed by an orchestra. Well before this (it was March 31) I had come across an article on The Globe and Mail by Chad Sapieha (I might have that name spelled wrong) about the latest installation at the Smithsonian exploring the idea of video games as art and I was entranced. It’s something I’ve argued for many years, that video games are the epitome of artistic convergence and finally it was being extolled by more than just the sidestream media. I had, however, forgotten that I’m different than most gamers, I like a very, very select few games and regard the majority of them as trash. I should have been reminded of my childhood years spent tracking when the old Electric Playground was on to get a brief 22-minute glimpse into the world of video games hosted by Tommy Tallerico — whom I thought at the time exemplified Hollywood douchebag. I should have remembered watching the show in horror as they featured the most inane bunch of games that were around those days. Rarely anything I was interested in was ever given more than a token mention, and worse, when they were nothing but good things were said, which is to say that all I was being told was what I wanted to hear…nothing new."

"So, I took it from my shelf to re-read it, for the first time since I'd been a teenager. Well, I wasn't wrong about the gore. (Who says modern YA fiction is shocking? Blimey!) High tension? Well, maybe, but you had to read a LOT of words first and unpick reams of long paragraphs and complex sentences. It's turgid prose, with masses of subordinate clauses. The opening paragraph consists of a single sentence of 148 words."
"A question encompassing both students and schools is whether paywalls will become a trend.

"This is a new piece I am working on. ""Doll Maker"" (oil on canvas) continues on a recent theme that I've been developing. The art and craft of doll making is quite fascinating, and not too removed from painting either. It combines the disciplines of sculpture, painting, sewing, and fantasy. It is like a painting come to life that you can hold, or a sculpture that you can dress and pose. The hair can be combed, and the glass eyes can be any color you like them to be."
As the game developed around the country schools got tired of playing against themselves and decided to expand their horizons and start playing against other schools with football teams in the region/area. The 1st ever game between two schools took place in the state of New Jersey on November 6th 1869 when Rutgers and Princeton Universities. The two schools located just 37. 1 miles away from each other developed a series and became rivals. The following year Columbia University joined the series which prompted Yale University and Stevens Institute of Technology to form a league or an early type of conference.

"A statement released by the coroner read as follows: “Having weighed up the evidence, it’s difficult to reach a verdict on whether the sad, sinister and ludicrously-reported death of Mr Williams was inflicted by himself or another. On the one hand, he was found dead padlocked inside a large bag, but on the other hand we also found a ladies’ wig in his bedroom and we suspect he may have been gay."
"According to a British journalist, WT Stead, the concentration camps were nothing more than a cruel torture machine. He writes: ""Every one of these children who died as a result of the halving of their rations, thereby exerting pressure onto their family still on the battle-field, was purposefully murdered. The system of half rations stands exposed and stark and unshamefully as a cold-blooded deed of state policy employed with the purpose of ensuring the surrender of people whom we were not able to defeat on the battlefield."""

"So, VOM, and the locals have figured out a way to tidy this mess up and make it all go away, and appear that there “really never was any suspicion that an iconic religious leader such as Tom White could commit such a heinous crime. Convenient for the “ministry” perhaps, and convenient for the city of Bartlesville, and sparing of Tom’s widow and family, but…..where is the real truth in all this? I think it got buried with Tom White."
"This is not a climate of extreme heat, though, and even our mildest beers are cloaked in the malt and hops that will satisfy on cloudy 60 degree June days. As a result, we have failed to exploit one brewing niche that brewers some hot regions offer--the German-style pilsner."
"While many of their people lived within their city, quite of few did not like it’s confines or the reminder of their journey to this planet. They stayed on the surface (as the ship had sunk deep into the ground, causing much of The Exodar to be beneath the land), either in the other towns that the Draenei had built, on the outskirts of the city, in the countryside of the islands they now called their home. Some even moved to other cities of their Allies: the peaceful and beautiful city of Darnassas, built in the boughs of a great tree (a world tree, she had learned. It was very fascinating that a larger tree used to exist, until the Burning Legion came, and the significance of such a tree to the planet. The Night Elves’ history was nearly as long as their people’s own history, and just as tragic); Stormwind, the human’s city of white stone and blue roofs, full of winding and twisting streets and bridges over watery canals; Ironforge, the impenetrable fortress of the Dwarves and Gnomes, built into the heart of a mountain with molten fires of the earth that burned night and day."

"It's amazing that human relations can determine sometimes what we eat, how we vote and how we educate our children. Such a statement, said or written so coldly, would probably provoke a stern response from those of us who believe we have the mental and physical capacity to make decisions about our diet, our political choices and our offspring. But scratch the surface and look closer and you'll occasionally find a complicated microcosm of self-doubts and nagging self-interrogation. Influenced in no small measure by the ""herd mentality"". Which is one of the reasons why we're fallible and make mistakes. And why some of those gaffes end up on Facebook twenty years later. And yet, there's still a certain beauty in it."

There is now a major international shift from oil to gas as a source for power generation."

"After Mummy’s first trimester, her vomiting began. She even became hyper-sensitive of her favorite spicy tuna dish and that is when I realized something was truly wrong. As a kid, I vividly remember being terrified of vomit. That disgusting, smelly, colorful substance was dreadful then and is just as dreadful today. I guess some things never change. Apparently my mother’s nausea was more pronounced because she was experiencing a fairly common side-effect of gestational diabetes, which she had. Living in Papua New Guinea at the time meant that advanced (and more effective) treatments were inaccessible. So, my family decided it was best for Mummy to have Nimisha (my sissy-poo) in India. Consequently, the last month of Mummy’s pregnancy was spent in Lucknow, where our huge and supportive family resides."

I started poking around looking for jewelry options online, then decided it might be cheaper just to make some pieces myself. So I ordered a bunch of beads and bits from Fire Mountain Gems.

"On this side of the water, the Occupy Wall Street protest and its equivalents in other American cities seem to have peaked for now, and the authorities have responded predictably by wading in with pepper spray and billy clubs. We’re still early in this particular game, though, far too early for either side to have a shot at winning or losing. Whether or not the protesters retain a token presence in urban centers over the winter, the coming of warm weather, the continuing decline of the American economy, and the public embarrassment of an upcoming presidential campaign in which nobody’s willing to talk about any of the real issues, will bring the protest kettle back to a steady boil in the new year."

I had to shake off thoughts about whether my vacation would be ruined. I talked to my parents.

If something doesn’t work, in this case my therapy with T – it has to be my fault. The reason for its failure has to lie within me. I know I have issues, and plenty of them, I’m just not so sure this is one of them. And frankly, the more I think about it, the more arrogant I think it is of T to just dismiss my concerns and label them transference. To his credit, he did ask me if I could remember him behaving inappropriately – which he hasn’t. Not inappropriately in the true meaning of the word. Just – arrogant. So quick to slap labels on every single little thing."

"Apophis is in fact the Greek name for the Egyptian mythological creature “Apep”; the symbol of all things evil, and chaotic in Egyptian culture, he was portrayed as a snake of unbelievable size and length. Snakes were not regarded as being inherently evil. Apophis is usually depicted in funerary texts and other settings as a great serpent, sometimes with tightly compressed, spring-like coils to emphasize his vast size. He is sometimes described as being over sixteen meters in length, with the first section of his body made of flint. He is usually shown being restrained, dismembered or in the process of being destroyed, often by multiple knives. In the tomb of Ramesses VI in the Valley of the Kings on the West Bank at Thebes (modern Luxor), Apophis is shown with twelve heads above its back representing those he has swallowed who are freed, if only briefly, when he is vanquished."

But he has them now -- thanks to Nora! -- and all's well, and we have a big laugh, and a great last breakfast together before taking Thomas back to school.

Rachel went to the private, Crimson Catholic School for Girls, right down the road from Poverty Central High School where Clinton attended.

It was love at first sight. When they did meet, they were shocked and surprised that they lived only a few miles apart and had never met. And while attending UK, they were inseparable and were voted “the most loved couple” on campus, four years in a row."

"I ran to my mother’s room and grabbed one of her handpainted glass antique lamps and broke out both windows. Smashing the lamp to pieces and screaming at the top of my lungs hoping a neighbor would hear. My attempts to get help went unnoticed and didn’t feel the sting of the needle as Kurt stabbed me with a syringe during my tirade. My face went numb as they placed the brunette wig and large sunglasses on me. Once at the airport, Kurt helped me into the Cessna and buckled me in. I only woke once on the trip as my head fell on Kurt’s shoulder and he moved. Several of Joe’s roadcrew were left behind to have the windows replaced before my mother returned home from work that evening."
"It’s sometimes difficult to appreciate events in history unless you were there. We know the stories handed down to us from tradition, or the media, or a textbook, but the distance tends to numb us to the situation, especially when our world is built on the results of those events. This can be seen in something like the Declaration of Independence. For Americans, who have grown up in the land of the free, we may know about the American Revolution, because we grew up here. We grew up without the monarchy, in a system of government that was formed at the time of the Revolution and has for us been the “way it’s always been”. For those who lived during the Revolution, it must have been very different, a big leap of faith, conflict between those who were still loyal to England and those who wanted independence, setting up a constitution for a new nation, a lot of trial and error and of course a big war to fight to gain it all."

"Thanks to everyone who left comments about our BIG snow! Yes, hubby did get home on Sunday and is now back at work on his normal shift! The sun is out today and it makes the snow even more beautiful! We are now preparing for the next BIG snow - due here on Wednesday - and will be going out today to buy some more munchies and kitty litter (I use that instead of the rock salt). The last time we had this much snow was in 2002-2003 when we had about 30"" and I had to go out to make a path for our dear old dog Tequila (the kids named her!) a great Doberman, German Shepherd, Pitbull mix, who was the best dog we ever had. She was old and couldn't jump through the snow drifts and wouldn't even consider using papers inside the house; so there I was, with hubby at work and son in the Air Force, digging her a path so she could go out and 'do her business'! She passed away at the great old age of 15 about 5 years ago and had a wonderful life, so we were sad but also happy that she was with us for so long. The kids are all out of school and I am sure will be heading out to go sledding today. I can see the birds checking out the berries on my winterberry bushes and then taking turns eating their fill. The viburnums have great berries too and they are also covered with hungry birds. Maya is out there now checking out the snow and getting ready to start jumping around! Actually, she is running right now as I type!"

"This beer pours a hazy golden color with one finger's worth of off-white head that faded quickly into decent spotty lacing. The nose hits pretty nicely on this beer and is full of pine, grapefruit, and other citrus spice, and only really a touch of caramel malt base on the nose. The flavor starts with plenty of hop bitterness followed by a big rush of citrus fruit and resinous pine flavor. The bitterness upfront settled down a bit about half way down my glass and then the caramel malt really provided a decent balance to the hops. I think this beer was brewed with only Columbus hops, but if anyone knows for sure please let me know. The wasn't much carbonation in this offering and it left an almost astringent bitterness lingering after the swallow. I am fine with that, but I can see how others would not like that in the finish. I think one bomber was just about perfect for me, and I would very much like to try the other IPA styles from Flossmoor."

"I certainly agree that it definitively shows that the earth becomes God’s domain, but I fail to see where it would specifically identify where the holy ones themselves would be ruling from, since the holy ones are not mentioned specifically in that vision. That’s why I say that this particular prophecy, without a guidepost to direct our interpretation of “kingdom”, does not settle for us the issue of where the holy ones will rule from. Naturally, the kingdom is partite, as you are using the word, for it will eternally involve both heaven and earth. The only real question is from “where do the holy ones reign”."

I had read many reviews raving about NARS blush in Orgasm, as well as Benefit’s Coralista, which both seemed to be peachy coral blushes with gold sparkles or shimmer. I had been looking into theBalm as a brand, and found their products much more appealing in terms of price and amount of product – Hot Mama was the most economical choice and seemed a similar colour – peachy coral with tiny specks of sparkle. Not to mention the packaging is adorable and it comes with a mirror inside."

"The Theseus Ensemble and Geoffrey Paterson continue to further their commitment both to perform challenging new music and to provide new ways for audiences to approach it, first and foremost amongst which are Paterson’s excellent spoken introductions with musical examples. Alexander Goehr’s Lyric Pieces were therefore introduced with brief comparisons between two of Schumann’s Davidsbündlertänze and two passages from Goehr’s work, which is to a certain extent built upon structures and gestures to be found in its predecessor: nothing laboured, nor indeed forbiddingly technical, but a way in for listeners who may conceivably have fretted about what to expect. Derivation and transformation, in these particular cases from the eighth and ninth Schumann pieces (both Florestan), were presented with admirable clarity, as indeed was the performance as a whole, which benefited equally from purposive command of line. Particularly striking was the echt-Romantic horn melody of the second of the six pieces, ‘Sostenuto, ma non troppo lento’, which, when joined by muted trumpet proved suggestive both in sonority and progress of Webern’s transcription from the Musical Offering (Bach’s masterpiece another Goehr favourite, perhaps far from incidentally). Trombone added an almost chorale-like impression, again furthering the sense not only of refracted Bach but Bach refracted via a refraction of German Romanticism. Stravinskian coolness from the ensemble’s woodwind offered a welcome counterpoint, in more than one sense. A sense of processional was doubtless furthered by timbral similarities with Varèse’s Octandre (the scoring is identical) and, inescapably, Symphonies of Wind Instruments. By contrast but also by connection, the liveliness of the third piece, both as work and performance, put me in mind of a more Germanic Pulcinella. The near-hypnotic repetitions of the fifth piece – already contextualised by that piano excerpt from the sixth Schumann piece – were heightened by intensification, again both in work and performance; this is no mere repetition, as Paterson’s keen rhythmic sense made clear. Indeed, there was a true spirit of the dance, both delightful and threatening. Echoes of the boisterous good spirits of Schoenberg’s First Chamber Symphony, surely a contender for the most life-affirming work of the twentieth century, were to be heard in the closing ‘Scherzando’, also possessed of an eloquent, wonderfully grainy bassoon soliloquy from Rosie Burton."

"I picked it up and started reading. And found that I couldn't put it down. Zombies play a huge role in this book. The things that happen couldn't happen without them. And yet, somehow, the novel isn't really about zombies. It is a YA book. It has the structures and concerns of many YA books. And it is a stand-out YA."

"So as you can see, I came up with some cute non 4 legged animals but if you really think about it, it's not easy to come up with many. We did discussed dolphins, but I don't know if I really consider them to be cute. The pink Amazon River dolphins are just plain scary, and I suppose the typical bottle nose dolphin can be kind of be cute, but I usually have to want to snuggle something before I'll consider it truly cute. I don't want to snuggle a dolphin and I actually would be terrified to swim with one because I couldn't even snorkel in a goldfish bowl without freaking out over the fish being near me in the water. I've been to Hawaii twice and panicked at the sight of even the smallest fish both times when I attempted snorkeling along the shore...I'm quite a pansy. I prefer ""urban snorkeling"", aka. going to an aquarium."
"When Gingrich's bus pulled up, Dillard stood silently holding his sign and watched the news-media horde swamp the candidate. Gingrich stepped down from the bus and made a beeline for Dillard. He stopped in front of Dillard and his sign and parked himself for a round of handshaking and pictures with voters. The placement couldn't have been worse. There was Gingrich, standing with his wife Callista at their first event of the day, and a giant Ron Paul sign floated inches from their crowns."

"A clear belief system was not part of my upbringing. My father was raised Jewish, my mother Protestant and my best friend was a Mormon. I only went to church when I was paid to play my horn. I once told my father that the reason our family was dysfunctional was because we didn’t go to church together. We can joke about it now but at the time it was the cry of a teen looking for answers."

Sure conformity is good sometimes, say, when you drive on the correct side of the road like everyone else.

Weakness: This isn’t one of Coach K’s best defensive teams. The Blue Devils are ranked among the ACC’s worse in several defensive categories including scoring defense and defensive field goal percentage.

"I may be alone a lot, but I still don’t think writing has to be as solitary as many people say. In fact, I think the internet offers a wide open community for writers with many different options. Yes, it’s a virtual community, but community none the less. Lets you know you’re not alone in the world. Now before anyone thinks I’ve lost my mind, no I’m not advocating just staying home and never venturing forth into the world, but I’m saying there are many sources of support for writers online."

"The complicated structure of the bacterial flagellum is sufficient all by itself to demolish the theory of evolution, since the flagellum has an irreducibly complex structure. If one single molecule in this fabulously complex structure were to disappear, or become defective, the flagellum would neither work nor be of any use to the bacterium. The flagellum must have been working perfectly from the first moment of its existence. This fact again reveals the nonsense in the theory of evolution’s assertion of “step by step development.” In fact, not one evolutionary biologist has so far succeeded in explaining the origin of the bacterial flagellum although a few tried to do so."

"A school is charged with attempting to ""educate"" hundreds of students to essentially the same level of competence in numerous arcane subjects. To do so while attempting to ensure that children ""learn"" is a near impossibility, unless the system is set up with rigid controls to cycle through the most people possible - which means that the entire system is set up to deliver to the least common denominator with the least amount of disruption. To combat this and reach maximum efficiency, a school district will resort to virtually any means possible to ensure that students sit still, pay attention, and ""learn."" Take this recent situation, for example; several states have banned the wearing of Silly Bandz Bracelets in their schools, because of the ""distraction"" it presents, which limits learning:"

With the holidays and everything around the corner there's just no way I'd get around to doing it until after the New Year.

"Earlier today, a colleague and I were discussing the reasons why some workers just seem unable to perform well in their roles. Now, I've been in HR for some time and I can tell you that most leaders truly care about the reasons why people do or do not perform up to standards. But as many times as I have had this conversation, it usually ends up with us talking about things like personal responsibility, accountability, and a basic understanding of the relationship between actions - or inactions - and consequences. Really, it's just basic human behavior, and 15 years in HR qualifies me to play pop psychologist now and again, apparently."
"I realize that this conclusion seems like folly, hokum or nonsense to committed materialists; it fits into the skeptical scheme of those who ridicule all things spiritual. But this isn’t an issue that can be settled by arguing over it. Each person must go through the process of experiencing second attention and finding out personally if higher reality exists. The proof lies in many areas, but the most crucial is the area we’ve been discussing. If stress ceases to create illness, damage, anxiety and pressure, if impressions no longer haunt us, if memory loosens its grip, then we can say that the world’s wisdom traditions had something valid to say."

"During the first few weeks of the season, everyone has too much fun projecting Opening Day home runs into 162-home run seasons, and watching batting averages like .917 or .083 accompany at-bats.** It’s fun– and to my mind is at the core of being a sports fan– to dream about an incredible 162-home run season. It’s just as fun to see a wacky batting average above .900, since we know that Opening Day dinger may be the only one some players hit until the All-Star break, and we know that .917 batting average will eventually come closer to .300. They are greater than our expectations."

I'm a single mom of 3 kids with a desire to better herself; there's got to be something out there that can help me! This was just a first step...

He could not be of one place, rooted and provincial. From his years living in Indonesia, where he was fully immersed in Javanese schools and culture; from his adolescence in Hawaii, where he was in the polyglot sea of hapa and haole, Asians and islanders; from his mother’s long-term commitment to development work overseas; from his friendship with Pakistani students at Occidental and his extended visit to their country—from all of these he had experienced far more global diversity than the average college junior.

"Too often we base our beliefs of the physical on Greek philosophy rather than the Bible. Plato wrote in the Republic that there are two realms: The Transcendent Realm (The Forms) and the Material Realm. The material realm is all that we see around us, whereas the Transcendent Realm is the the Realm of The Forms. The ultimate form was that of Goodness, the form of all forms. This invisible realm was where true reality was according to Plato, and the material realm, the world we occupy, is nothing more than a obscure, dim, misleading at times representation of that true realm. Though this is a simplification x1000, you get the idea that for Greeks, the physical world was for many that which obstructed our view of truth and reality and therefore, for many Greeks, the physical world was looked down on. With this in mind, doesn’t this seem more like our attitude in the Church rather than what is shouted and screamed and celebrated (graphically and erotically I might add) in the book of Song of Solomon?"

If a creature comes too close to the pod, it opens up and releases a long shoot, which grabs onto the victim. This infects the victim, slowly turning them into a Krynoid. The victim becomes weak and starts developing plant-like characteristics. At this stage, they still have most of their personality, if intelligent, though they crave animal proteins in order to grow. As time passes, they grow larger and begin to lose all vestiges of their original physical form. Their original personality is lost to the Krynoid sentience."

What is describable of vision-in-Black is something clearer: the seeing of place itself, wherein universe or 'creation' is revealed to be actual allegory, the other-being of the Real. Vision-in-Black names the scene (from skia, shadow) of mysticism, the shadowy place of extensive non-difference between the negative darkening of knowledge and the black brilliance of seeing beyond light. Vision-in-Black is the landscape in which truth travels securely, where one moves as the limitless in of the Real: secret in secret. This is the topological union of mystical movement and dwelling, the paradoxically paradisical way of wilderness wherein exposure and dereliction are perfect security and enclosure. The left hyphen, between vision and in, corresponds to the term of movement and exposure, the extensive vector of secret: seeing the"

"At a third level, however, the story represented a failure of the Times’ public editor, a position established in the wake of the Jayson Blair scandal to represent the readers and to champion journalistic integrity from within the paper. Then-public editor Byron Calame penned two columns on the lacrosse case. The first, which appeared in spring 2006, minimized even the factual inaccuracies that had marred Roberts’ early columns. The second, which came after the exonerations in spring 2007, denied any ideological bias to the Times coverage, and declined even to speculate on why the Times had gotten the story so wrong for so long. It was left to the AJR and the Chronicle to analyze the Times’ wreckage."

"You literally smear it all over your face and neck and then wipe off with a tissue or a warm wet facecloth. This stuff is so old school, but I LOVE it. Seriously, after using it I wondered why I was worried about breaking out. Normally, we wash all the natural oils out of our face with harsh cleansers, then reapply cream. Why not skip a step? My face is SO soft the next day and the way it removes makeup is unreal. I usually use a liquid based eye makeup remover and always look like a raccoon the next morning no matter how clean I thought my eyes were. This never happens with this cold cream now."
"But in Britain today, we have a further cause for grave concern. A world-respected news organisation (the BBC) that is State supported – but not State controlled – now faces a stand-up market share battle with that very same mogul-owned media group.

"I'll tell you why. Meteor may have cost a good amount of money to make, but it had a cheap script. It had producers willing to cut corners. It had actors who didn't believe in the project. It had a premise that may have worked if the effects were better and the sense of urgency was there. That Meteor failed in every avenue is not so much of a surprise as it is an indictment of what was wrong with science fiction after the success of 1977's Star Wars."

"The warning shouts of Bobby’s mother came from a heart of love and concern for Bobby’s welfare and safety. God warns us as well because He loves us deeply and wants to rescue us from the impending disaster of that thud in our own lives. It’s easy to think of God’s warnings and prohibitions as His attempt to take all the fun out of our lives, but that’s so wrong. In fact, nothing would give Satan more joy than getting you to think like that, because the more you think like that, the easier it is for him to “devour” you. And that’s a thud that I never want to hear!"

"Have you “done good” for years? Have you ever, in the quiet of your heart, in those times of doubt, secretly wondered when and if you were ever going to reap the benefits? Perhaps you might be wondering why you even bother doing the Father’s will. Have you tallied up your deeds and sacrifices and decided you’ve got a higher, bigger stack of “good” than others? Or maybe you’ve watched others and were resentful of the amount of “payback” they have received. Or, perhaps you have done good and wished you hadn’t, and plan on stingily holding back in the future. “Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance.

And I’m writing it to know that, among the peaceful: you are not crazy for thinking that we are approaching a turning point in our country where the realities of decades of profit-over-all-else mentality are becoming not just undeniable, but are confronting us in our day to day lives in ways we did not think was possible in a country that now seems, in retrospect, to have been the least Western, least democratically-minded country to be considered so. And that turning point might require widespread civil disobedience, in the name of the environmental and economic survival of our country and our people (as well, of course, as the vast masses like us all around the world, in other countries)."

"So it was nice to hear some good word for AZC this week. First up, the wonderful folk at Crimespree Magazine: “You will be amused as hell, philosophically aroused and mentally sated as you wonder how Burke can pull it off. And pull it off he does. A courageous, droll and satisfying read.” - Crimespree Magazine And then, out of the blue, that very fine author Paul Johnston got in touch to say he’d read the book, and quite liked it: “Do you know how difficult it is to write a postmodern crime novel that is both funny and moving? The only person I knew to have pulled that off was Robert Coover in his imaginatively titled NOIR. Now Declan Burke has done it even more successfully in ABSOLUTE ZERO COOL. A true one-off: witty, profound, sad and ... cool as hell.” - Paul Johnston In the interest of clarity, transparency, accountability and non-Bertie Ahern-ish shenanigans, I should point out that (a) I write for Crimespree Magazine and (b) I reviewed Paul Johnston’s latest novel, THE SILVER STAIN, very positively last month - the review here is a longer version of an original that appeared in the Irish Times."

"A pancake post seemed rather appropriate with Mardi Gras (a.k.a. Fat Tuesday or Pancake Tuesday) just around the corner.

"There is some bloodshed though – this isn’t strictly comedy – but considering how sexual the situation is there is almost no sexuality, which again illustrates the cultural differences between the Americans and the Chinese.

Personally I try and be a decent human to everyone I meet at shows. The world doesn't need another asshole musician. There are plenty out there."

"It is no secret that IUSB Vision Editor Chuck Norton is no fan of Ron Paul, but when he gets it right he deserves credit just as anyone else. Representative Paul knocked the TSA question out of the park. The TSA is abusive and recently an agent raped a prominent blogger by penetrating her vulva four times, and then threatened to sue her for speaking out about it. The TSA is ineffective which has been proved time and time again by the GSA whose inspectors are able to sneak guns, bombs, and other weapons on planes in over 80% of attempts. Ron Paul is correct that it is government who set up the stage for the 9-11 hijackings by telling people not to resist and by preventing pilots from having deadly force training and guns."

Organization is important. Look at the application -- is it laid out in a logical way? Do they ask for information that seems pertinent? Are their regulations and guidelines easy to understand ... and do they make sense? Some applications include a map of the venue -- does the layout make sense? Do they have adequate parking -- for vendors and for customers?

"Saturday I spent several hours at the bi-annual rummage sale in our church. That was fun because we got to chat while helping, plus at the end of the sale, we had a dollar for a bag, and boy did I snag some awesome stuff. For a buck. One dollar. You can tell I am thrilled. After that, and I had a whole list, I did manage to get a bunch of laundry and house stuff done, then sat down to watch TV. Undisturbed. For hours. I got up to make dinner and do some baking and that was it. Two episodes of Eureka, two of Warehouse 13, 1 of DS9 and half of William Shatner’s “the Captains” documentary later I was asleep on the couch and it was time for bed.

"Firstly, I don’t see why we want to restrict children and can’t expose children at an early stage to two or more languages since their brains are literally like sponges. It’s evident how quickly they pick up – Mittens has already long learnt how to count from 1 to 10 in Spanish, and I had to Google it and commit it to memory just to keep up with him. Perhaps teaching too many languages full on might be a bit much, but exposing them to several words or phrases can’t do any harm. Apart from learning Chinese in school and at home, I’ve also been trying to teach him how to count in Japanese and French."

As speculated in an earlier post here, there was very little time to debate the Bill in any substantive way. As soon as the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha took up the Bill in the house, a few parliamentarians, notably Mr M V Mysura Reddy, raised a ‘Point of Order’. (A Point of Order is an issue raised in the course of parliamentary debate whenever it appears that a rule may have been broken. Usually, the issue has to be resolved before parliament may continue)."

"Despite my speed, the four of us were still late for the ceremony. That would have been fine if it hadn't been the CREAKIEST CHURCH EVER, thus our attempt at a subtle, muted entry prompted the capacity crowd to turn and ponder us as we took our seats. We’d missed the walk down the aisle which, unlike the opening credits of a movie, is quite crucial if you want to get a good look at the Great Dress Reveal. Suddenly, with a tap on the shoulder, the couple’s rings were handed to us. They were being handed around the church during the ceremony so everyone had the chance to pray over them... except we missed the part where they explained that, so we just thought we were all being given a chance to admire the rings (and dutifully did so)."

The Problems
The next of many differences I present in this article is Heavenly Father and Jesus being one in the same. As Christians we believe the Bible when it tells us that Jesus Christ is God in flesh. To take away Jesus’ identity and place him next to another god with flesh and bones is definitely a different gospel.

"But since the CSM moved to a larger property in Greenwich, New York, in 2003, little has been done to the 1876 Abbey and 1896 Chapel buildings. The interiors of each are, for the most part, gutted; work was begun on the buildings, but never completed, due to the subprime mortgage collapse. Some significant interior architectural features have been left intact, but the majority of the structures have been stripped down to their frames. The properties are owned by Ginsburg Development, and their website indicates that they will be developed as ""The Abbey at Fort Hill"", a 12-unit luxury condo complex. This would be to the benefit of the town of Peekskill, which sorely needs the tax revenue, but also to the benefit of the Community of St. Mary - as part of the proposed development, Ginsburg would relocate the cemetery to the Greenwich location, bringing the founding Sisters to the modern convent."

Let’s get one thing straight first of all. Animals are stupid.
"There is another aspect of our economic crisis that has been overlooked by many. Why is it that the poorest could not afford to pay for their mortgages? Why is it that inequality reached the same level in 2008, as it had been in 1929, just before the last financial crash – coincidence? I do not believe so. During the period from the Second World War until the 1970′s, we were becoming a more equal society and the lot of the average worker was improving. However, since the late 1970′s, inequality in the UK and US has been rising astronomically. In real terms, the income of the average person has not risen at all in 40 years, yet the real income of the richest has risen astronomically in that time. Similarly, wealth inequality has increased dramatically, with the proportion of wealth owned by the top 1% increasing from 17% to 23% since 1980. The means the average person has seen no increase in their spending power and they are losing their access to wealth generating assets. When inequality begins to get to such a dangerous level – demand falls."

"I shared my personal reality. At home, my boys rarely sit through a meal. My 10-yr-old is prone to eating on his feet; he's still my Most Likely to Fall Off a Chair for No Apparent Reason. My 8-yr-old constantly rocks his chair and all of my boys are more than happy to leap up from the table to peer out the window. And often, I let it go. I reinforce proper behavior, but I know that expecting my four boys, ages 5 to 13, to eat every meal while seated properly is a bit beyond their current capabilities. So I tolerate a certain amount of physical movement during a meal. I know that my sons are quite capable of adapting their behavior to the situation (even at this age, they understand the difference between lunch at home and Christmas dinner at Grandma's), and that their behavior will change as they grow."

Is this your first book?
"Remember those choose-your-own-adventure books? (Muse: Katherine's showing her age here!), where you could read a few pages of a story and then, when you reached the place where the hero met the dragon, you could choose between “hero slays dragon” and “dragon eats hero”, flipping to a different page according to your choice to continue reading? With a printed book, this was always a bit clumsy. You had to flip through the pages manually, and on the way you might accidentally see another part of the story. If nothing else, by the time you’d finished flipping back and forth, the book looked grubby and choose-your-own-adventure books had a limited lifespan. With an e-book, however, you could have hyperlinks in the text to do the “flipping” for you, and navigate your way around the story a bit like the hero in a game."

But, now you want to get through the gatekeeper and get to the decision maker, right? So, when do you call? My suggestion is to call anytime the gatekeeper is away from his/her desk which would be during lunch hour, before 9am and after 5pm. Generally decision makers will have much longer office hours then their receptionists and you will have a better shot at catching them at that time."

"And that’s just the short term benefit, the immediate upside to having your work improved right now. But working with a great editor is, to borrow a Hallmark Cards truism, a gift that keeps on giving.

He or she will have made you a better writer."

"When I turned 14, I decided it was time I start learning real things on the piano. No more kid-oriented things that had no musical significance (in essence, or for me). I went to the music store and urged my mother to let me get a big lavender book of Frédéric Chopin's Complete Ballades, Impromptus & Sonatas. I had no idea what a Ballade, Impromptu, or Sonata was, and I can't remember if I even knew who Chopin was. I must have, or I wouldn't have been so interested in buying it. I opened the book and could not read a single line, even without being at the piano, but I knew that I MUST learn something out of it, even if it took me a century, I would do it. I bought it and took it home. I had just gotten a new piano for my birthday, (and I still love the shit out of that piano), so I was anxious to start playing some real music on it. The first piece in the big lavender book was Ballade No. 1 in G minor, Op. 23. To this day, it is my favorite piece of Chopin's music. I cannot find a single fault with it. I was able to play the first page no problem, and would often play it for my mother while she sat outside on the porch because it was just so beautiful. I remember turning the page and deciding to go ahead and tackle the whole thing - who would want to hear just the first page? I learned the second page, the third page, and then on the fourth page I realized that I had probably gotten really over my head. So I skipped pages four and five. Six wasn't quite as bad, so I picked that up as well, and while seven was tough I liked to pretend I could get through it. I went through the rest of the thirteen pages like this until I could safely say I ""learned"" this piece, for better or for worse. I played it every day, over and over again. I started at all different places, almost never the beginning, until I memorized virtually every single note in the entire piece (except, of course, pages four and five). I still have journals in which I documented my progress with the piece, writing how badly I want to learn the whole thing, how badly I want to memorize it and play it straight through by myself. I wanted to internalize the piece and be completely consumed by it. I bought a recording of the piece played by Ashkenazy or something and would sit with the score in my lap and turn it all the way up. I didn't know the terms with which one would describe the things Ashkenazy did with the music, such as rubato and rallentando or a tempo. I just took a pencil and wrote things like ""nothing too fancy at first"" and ""some tone quality, but not full-force"" and... what else... ""bring this out"" and ""play fast"" (I even wrote, literally, ""take time plz"" at one part) and notes saying to sing out the melody as if I were a singer. I was coaching myself to play the piece exactly like the recording. I was reminding a future-version of myself to play as I hoped someday to play. I was so encompassed by the piece, but there was always something missing. I had a few teachers hear me play it, and they never discouraged me but there were definitely some wrong notes that I had learned due to wanting to learn as much as possible over a short period of time. As I grew up, however, and moved to other pieces... I did stop playing it. I stopped opening up my big lavender book, I stopped spending hours on a single piece until my hands screamed for rest. I stopped drilling passages that I thought were simply IMPOSSIBLE to be conquered, stopped playing and re-playing sections that my hands were just not large or agile enough to handle. I moved on. Aside from some pieces that I do not care for, I barely played any Chopin again."
"I might add, not as part of the review, in light of later events in Japanese history, it is a bit chilling to read the authors defense of Japanese aggressions in Manchuria and Korea, especially when they suggest that the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910 was for the benefit of the Korean people. I think few Koreans would agree with that sentiment."

My fellow workers eyes teared up with muddy puddles of salt and water. He appeared to be shaking, not out of fear but out of complete brokeness. His bottom lip quivered and his heavy eyes pointed at me while his head still faced the ground. A raspy and contrite tone came from him saying “I have been praying for that for years and years and years”."

"I recognize that history changes, rights change, often there are conflicting rights, and one must always do whatever one can to minimize human suffering and seek as equitable a solution as possible (provided of course both sides are prepared to negotiate). Ben Gurion gave a far better analogy–the analogy of two families claiming the same home. That is closer to reality. Many Arabs migrated into Palestine when Jewish immigration created jobs and opportunities. But still, if two people do share a home they can negotiate a settlement and agree to a partition. But what if one side resolutely refuses to partition the house, then claims foul when he is evicted and keeps on trying to climb back in?"

"For long we have equated chauvinism with males. After all, we all have been living in a male dominated, patriarchal society for ages. So, male chauvinists were bound to exist in plenty especially since we found women facing obstacles every time they made an attempt to advance in life or tried out something that was slated to be male domain. So, men with conservative views about what women should be or do abounded in plenty. But, are all women the same miserable tortured lot even today? The women, who have waged and won many of their wars with society for equality and rights, do some if not all, stand innocent when it comes to making use of their freedom? Are not some women victimizing the very men they accused of being chauvinists?"

"On Tuesday I decided that some speed intervals were required and so had Jeff Galloway. He drawled that today we will be doing some race pace intervals and, as the weather wasn’t good, I opted for the treadmill. I had put Jeff and his Easy 10k away, but now that the evenings are stretching out I have more time for longer runs and so out he’s come again. It’s nice having that structure. One of the other reasons why I’d stopped using the app was because it was pushing me too hard and I was becoming despondent. Scratch that. I was pushing myself too hard, as usual. I’d got my heart set on subbing 60 minutes for my 10k, from a 65 minute PB. Rather than aim for 59 minutes I was aiming for 55, attempting to knock 10 minutes off my time and I was near killing myself in the process! I am now wearing my sensible hat, have readjusted the app and it’s now set for 10 minute miles. With any luck one mile will be 9 minutes long! The difference, as I told my husband afterwards as we soaked in the hot tub (who needs ice baths?) was that I could easily manage the race pace sprints in the middle of the run, instead of struggling to finish them and sometimes even stopping to walk during them."

Thankful to have started, I now seem unable to stop–and for that, I am deeply grateful."

"2011 was a year of extremes. From the tragedy of Japan’s devastating earthquake and tsunami, to the pageantry of a British Royal wedding; from the wave of revolutionary change in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya, to the solemn commemoration that took place on September 11, we reflect on a passing year filled with emotion, knowing the world will never be the same."

"Another law is that the more laws that are created to protect children, the more children will be abused, tortured and killed as a result, especially if it is in Florida or California. Mickey Mouse and the gang definitely fit into all of it. California is really out there when it comes to this. It is beyond debate that California judges, state social workers and other facilitators are engaged in Satanic, child abuse rituals and in making sure that children are placed in, or returned to truly terrible conditions, where they can be harmed and tormented for extended periods of time. I have listed very little of what I have come across and using a major search engine will turn up more information than you could read and absorb in a very long time. A few months ago, more or less, there was an article that listed case after case, after case in California, where the courts were returning large numbers of children to abusive situations, when a sane and caring parent was available to receive them. In case after case, the courts returned these children into the hands of monsters, who already had a history of violating them and turned a deaf ear to the good parent; often the parent who had brought it to their attention in the first place and who was backed up by the testimony of the children and corroborating medical evidence."

"With Fire with Fire, the narrative kept changing. At first I thought we were in a firefighting movie (it’s called Fire with Fire, it’s about a firefighter, and the first scene is a fire). Then it becomes a witness relocation movie. Then it becomes a revenge film. Then it turns into a gang war film. I’m not saying you can’t change directions in a script. We were just talking yesterday about doing this at the midpoint. But if you keep doing it, the reader starts becoming confused. I know I was. “What kind of movie is this exactly?” I kept asking. You really have to be a great writer to pull this off and while O’Connor is a very good writer, I would’ve loved to have seen more focus in this area."

I think we’ve all had a thing for the girl who everyone in our lives hoped would maybe fall down some stairs and break her face open. I think we’ve all projected good looks to mean good person. It’s true maybe off camera she is awesome, but unfortunately, ABC had a pretty easy time demonizing her. I thought back on it and even the dude wearing the mask last year was more likeable."
"Then, bliss -- the cool air of the lobby of the theater, and a glorious theater it is. An opera house that seats 2,000.

I mean, Miss New Jersey with smelly armpits?! But this is probably more than you want to know."
"Everyone in the book is suffering – My wife is unhappy, goes one chapter heading; My daughter’s unhappy, another; My little boy is having difficulties – and we don’t know how miserable they really are, and how much of it is distorted through Slocum’s poisoned view. If all first-person narratives seem predominantly to be about the narrator, Something Happened removes all doubt. Slocum’s story is a towering monument to himself. Of his wife he says, “I want to be free of her before her health fails. I see an ailing wife in my future.” When his daughter tells him she isn’t happy, “I told her I wasn’t either and nobody had a right to expect to be.” His weakness for honesty is fatal to his family. To his worrisome son (who asks “If you do want to get rid of me, how will you do it?”), he is unable to offer the categoric reassurance he needs. His workplace is not much better (the salesmen are “a vigorous, fun-loving bunch when they are not suffering abdominal cramps or brooding miserably about the future”), though it has its compensations. (“This fiscal period, I am flirting with Jane.”)"

After I discovered the perfect brush for both applying and blending, I then found a great brush cleaner that not only cleans and sterilizes but dries almost instantly.

"Revolting as it may sound to pronounce such words, what should matter to policy-makers is not Is it revolting, but rather Is it true. If it was true then, and still is true, then the consequences for Euro-American policy-makers are vast. Except for the brief disaster known as Reconstruction, the great experiment of putting municipal government into the hands of Afro-Americans is still young. The results thus far have ranged from worrying to calamitous. Bringing in ethnically Euro managers from the outside to save these cities from themselves may be the only answer, as unhappily this 'race in its childhood' shows time and again that its adulthood lies somewhere in the future."
"I am grateful for my day job, though, even if I’m less than enthusiastic about it. Over the last twelve years it has provided me with a home, a series of cars, paid for my wedding, supported my children and funded my unhealthy relationship with alcohol. And each job I’ve done within the organisation (I have been promoted a number of times, and quite recently, demoted) has been just uninspiring enough to urge me to find an alternative source of satisfaction."

"Anyway, a few years later, after the momentous discovery of authenticity, I found myself with a small mountain of pretty, but useless, frocks. Mum kept a couple (I am kicking myself not not getting pics of them too when I was over there this morning) and the rest I ripped the embroidery off and clagged them onto a green wool tunic for my stepdad, Peter, figuring that since they do the odd village fete, etc, where some kind of half hearted attempt at costume is required, he could make use of it.

"What the parties wanted to know was whether the exception for ephemeral recordings under copyright law also covered recordings made by legally independent external television production companies where those recordings were commissioned from them by DR or by TV2 Danmark for initial broadcast on DR or TV2 Danmark. According to DR and TV2 Danmark, it was irrelevant to copyright holders whether recordings for purposes of transmission were made by the staff of thea broadcasting organisation itself with its own equipment, or by an employee of a third company from which the broadcasting organisation commissioned the production, with that third company’s equipment. They also argued that there was no condition in Paragraph 31 of the Danish Law on Copyright to require broadcasting organisations to make recordings ‘by means of their own facilities’. Thus, under Danish law, it didn' tmatter, for the application of the exception concerning recordings for the purpose of transmission, whether those recordings were made by employees of the broadcasting organisation or by employees of third parties. NCB however argued that European Union law imposed a condition relating to production ‘by means of their own facilities’, this condition being applicable under the Danish Law on Copyright. The Østre Landsret (Eastern Regional Court) decided at this point that it was better to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling than to become increasingly baffled by these arguments.

"If you only knew one thing about a woman and had to guess her income, education level would be a good place to start. But when it comes to personal advice — to understanding our own lives — we know so much more than that. Only then — for example, after we have narrowed down the pool to college-educated, professional suburbanites between 40 and 50 years old — do the studies about women’s negotiating ability, shoe style, and so on, make a big difference. Marginal things matter, but for most people they’re not the causal story. Put another way, they matter more for populations than they do for individual readers."

"Conceding the plausibility of this, isn't it also true that no total exception exists? No decision made in a vacuum of institutional legal order could be in any way effective. There is a lot of law below the level of the constitution or even statutory law -- army and police codes and rules about chain of command, quite significantly -- that need to be depended on especially in a state of exception. So the decision itself always requires a residue of the norm to be put into effect. Since, moreover, the cooperation of these institutions is also a matter of decisions made in the chain of command, this also shows that the decision is not unitary. And all this is to say nothing of the place of informal norms about the conduct in politics which do much to determine the actual paths of events in cases where the law is not explicit."

"A decorated veteran of World War I, Hitler joined the German Workers' Party, precursor of the Nazi Party, in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923 he attempted a coup d'état, known as the Beer Hall Putsch, in Munich. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anticommunism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. After his appointment as chancellor in 1933, he transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. His aim was to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in continental Europe."

"The universal hatred of the apartheid regime in white South Africa has blinded us to the reality of the acts of murder, torture and terrorism committed by the Spear of the Nation, which Mandela and his colleagues presided over in their leadership of the ANC. This helps to explain why, until the beginning of July 2008, Mandela was still on the US list of terrorists."

I got messed on my GRE study guides since they changed the whole format of the test right after I took it. . . Too bad–that could have been an extra $20 (for 5 large books)! I think I saved all the texts from my major and minor too–but they’re in storage. In Nevada. And probably too old/irrelevant to sell anyway.

"Let's move on to flipping out. Flipping out - screaming, getting angry, throwing things, whatever - is nothing more than an emotion. It is not an effective way to shape the behavior of others. I've had plenty of people flip out on me in my lifetime, and never once did I walk away thinking ""wow, they are so right, and I am so happy they flipped out because now I have really learned something."" No, the opposite happens; you learn to avoid them, to conceal behavior that they find unacceptable, and to feign contrition in order to get them to calm down. Of course, you also feel completely itimidated, scared, and physically threatened. I cannot learn under those conditions, and will in short order come to resent and avoid any person who treats me that way."
"With work starting up again tomorrow, my summer and Lady of Leisure days have come to an end. This has been one of the more enjoyable summers. I celebrated my one year wedding anniversary with Mr. Incredible, I road tripped, gambled, spent time with my family, and did a whole lot of baking. Although I'm sad to see summer go, I look forward the cold fall season (even though that probably won't be until November in Texas), the holidays, and of course the baking that goes along with celebrating the holidays. So I bid farewell to my summer vacation with a bread full of flavors that remind me of summer...blueberries and lemons."
"As a general guideline, plan on serving 3-4 pieces per person, per hour for a reception. You have a variety of both hot and cold choices for canapés and hors D’oeuvres. If the reception is going to be their dinner, add on some items with substance or maybe a pasta or stir fry station. If you have expensive items like jumbo shrimp or mini lamb chops, have them passed to avoid “campers” who stand in front of the food and eat it all. Having some of the items passed will help keep your costs down because you won’t run out and have to order more, everyone theoretically will have the opportunity to have some and the passing service adds a touch of elegance to the event."
"Look at verse 4. He says to them and this from his own personal experience, “Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice.” He calls for them to rejoice. Now this is a command. By the way, we are called to rejoice about 70 times in the New Testament. Even where Paul says, “I will glory in my suffering,” the Greek is “I will rejoice.” This is a present imperative which means he calls us to habitual continual practice of rejoicing."

It basically means I have to lie on the couch for hours and only get up to use the bathroom or fix myself or the kids a quick sandwich. I've watched every show on daytime tv, which, let me just say: there is literally nothing good on except House Hunters and Paula Deen! During the other 23 hours of the day, I've been reading... one book after the next. I've found myself reading auto biographies like The Glass Castle, Angela's Ashes, and The Hiding Place. While some people might find this kind of reading depressing, I find it cathartic. It's nice to be reminded there are other people out there who have seen worse... much worse."

"There are many ways that this question could have been answered, ranging from the politically correct through to the honest and commonsense. The fact that the staff at the school felt it appropriate to drag the boy's poor mother into school and attempt to force her to sign a form condemning her son for an alleged thought-crime is a damning indictment indeed of these so-called teachers. Those responsible should hang their heads in shame and be thrown out of the school and banned from ever working with children again. Politically correct indoctrination is a form of child abuse and those who practice it should be treated accordingly."
"Rickey was crossing a street when he was 13, and saw a man who had been killed while he stumbled across the street in a drunken stupor, shrouded by a blood-stained sheet, surrounded by police and onlookers. As he craned his neck to see better, his mother pulled him away, saying “You don’t need to see that”. When he got home, he found out on the evening news that the man was his father. Rickey’s mother had asked his father’s boss, a few years before, to give her the checks, since her husband was drinking away all the money. He complied, and eventually the two of them moved in together, breaking up his marriage. When Rickey’s mother later moved to an apartment, then moved out again, Rickey stayed put, got a job at age 16, and encouraged his girlfriend to move in with him. The landlord said he was a Christian and did not want Rickey living with a girl he was not married to, so Rickey asked her to marry him, and they began life together. He was initially touched and influenced by his praying, church-going mother-in-law, who was part of an intact and loving family. It was only a few months, however, before Rickey’s in-laws’ family crumbled as his wife’s mother moved out with another woman. This was to be the pattern set in Rickey’s life: when he was influenced by the Gospel, the failures of men tore his faith down again."

"On 16th May, the UK will be holding its first National Flash Fiction Day. If you don’t know what Flash Fiction is, then here is a great introduction to the genre. I love writing Flash, partly for the challenge of conveying a story in the absolute minimum of words but mainly because I’m too harsh an editor of my short stories and what was once 1000 words becomes 250! There are some fantastic writers taking part including quite a few twitter friends. I don’t think this is a coincidence – if you have to make a concise point in 140 characters, 140 words can feel like a whole novel!"

So on an ordinance survey map, which is pinned to the wall, we have 12 dots of 5 colours so that's 60 dots, to show where each team play, there are 5 divisions, then in the A-Z we also have another 60 coloured dots of where the football pitches are. So why you ask? If you didn't you are going to get the answer anyways! This is so he can give games to the referee's who live near the pitches, or the coloured dots in our case!!!! Now tell me you are glad you asked then LOL!"

"Robert Aldrich made one of most people’s favorite war movies in The Dirty Dozen. In fact he made all kinds of great movies encompassing almost every genre. By 1956 he had turned out a handful of fine pictures, including Kiss Me Deadly and Vera Cruz. That year he turned his hand to the war movie and came up with the superior and intense Attack. This came at a time when the war film was transitioning from the flag-waving efforts of the forties to more bitter and realistic portrayals of combat."
"Greg X. Volz had been the amazing vocalist with Petra, the group that had first caught my attention four years earlier. Greg had left the group to embark upon a solo career and was on the heels of two superb albums. Mark Farner had been the front man of Grand Funk Railroad, one of the most successful rock acts of the early 70s. Mark had turned to Christian music and gone solo, hitting the Christian charts with his recordings. They were both known artists with respectable histories behind them."

"In 2008, the premiers of Ontario and Quebec pledged that each province would protect half of its northern boreal forests. There is now hope that the 190 million acres of boreal forest in Ontario and Quebec will eventually be made off-limits. Last year, 21 of Canada’s largest logging companies and nine conservation groups proposed the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement to support the protection of more than seventy million acres."
"That spring a wonderful thing happen. The old woman's tea bushes grew lush and tender leaves. The tea was so frangrant and lovely that all the villages wanted to share in her tea. She gladly gave them cuttings and seed. So all the tea bushes in Dragon Well were eventually planted from those bushes. The tea became famous through-out the land and instead of being called ""Old wife's Tea"" it coined a new name called ""The Ancestor of Tea""."
"When I was about 13, I was invited by a friend of mine to attend church with her. She went to a big, impressive Southern Baptist church that had just opened a cool new family activity center that had a gym, an indoor running track, classrooms, etc. Other friends of ours attended this church, and so I thought nothing of it when I agreed to accompany her family to a few worship services. Since my family didn't ""do"" church, the only way I was going to go to church at all was going to be by tagging along with another family who did."

You see someone else openly abusing her, so you do it too. You see people saying that any other lad would do the same – that they would do the same. Confirmation bias enters in – these are people who agree with you that this guy was stitched up by some silly bitch who can’t handle her drink, ‘yeah’, you think, ‘who wouldn’t do the same, silly whore’, and you join in. #justiceforched you type. Then some of your new found compatriots start naming her and you are so caught up in this whirlpool that you do it too – stupid cow had it coming."

"Take a moment to write down some of the beliefs you have about reality. What do you believe to be true about your health, career, relationships, finances, spirituality, etc? Then go over the eight criteria above to see how they measure up. If you don’t like what you see, craft more effective beliefs to replace the old ones. Remember that your beliefs are not mere observations of reality — they shape and create your reality as well. Many of the thoughts you hold most sacred may reveal their hidden falsehoods once you take the opportunity to test one or two alternatives."

But what this means for us is a whole new layer of things to do in the kitchen."

"The registering of a baby's birth actually passes 'ownership' of the baby to the Local Authority and that, THAT ALONE, allows the 'Local Authority' staff/officers and the Courts to take the child away from the parents if they ever wanted to do that. This applies until the child reaches the 'age of maturity' set by the current legal 'Statutes'. Doing that is not 'LAWFUL' but after the birth has been registered, it is 'LEGAL' and there is a WORLD of difference between those two terms, a difference which it is VERY IMPORTANT that"
"As we walked back towards the agricultural shed where we store our machinery, I mentioned to Gérard that all that remained to be tidied up was the field nearest the shed. I verbally patted him on the back and waxed lyrical on the great progress we have made over the years clearing up such a neglected property. I basked in my reminiscences and recollections, reminding him of how our farm once looked. As we moved closer towards the shed he became quieter, almost sheepish. I still, naive woman that I am, hadn't put two and two together....Can you guess? Are you more in tune with 'French farmer logic' than me?"

"These are based on Dan Lepard's salted oat crackers - I've replaced both the flour and oats and given them a double spelt boost in the form of spelt flour and these rolled spelt flakes. I've also decreased the liquid as I find spelt flour tends to be softer and a general rule is that for any recipe where you've replaced plain flour for spelt, always be careful on the amount of liquid needed, you'll generally find it's going to be less."

"This week's Tightwad Tuesday is a tip we've all have heard before. Don't toss out those leftovers! Find a way to use them up. Luckily for me, Hubz came from a family of leftover eaters. We don't have much go to waste around here, but it isn't always thanks to my superb culinary skills. It mostly boils down to him not having a problem snacking on leftovers or taking them for lunch or, if there's a big pot of chili, eating them for nights on end."
"But if there's one thing I should've figured out by now, it's that the forecast here is never right. The forecast will change drastically throughout the day and still manage to be off. They predicted snow yesterday, but said there would be little to no new accumulation. I'd say there were a good 4 inches of snow piled up out there during the day and it was still snowing hard when we went to bed. The forecast (which, of course, may or may not be accurate) is also calling for another 2-4 inches of accumulation tonight. I'm hoping that the chance of rain and above freezing temperatures predicted for later in the week don't pan out. I'd really like to spend Christmas day building a snowman and sledding."

"The final bit of important info we get from this episode is the other story about those who got spirited away. Apparently their school was built over a shrine, and as a result, the school was “cursed”. The girl who vanished (whom they perceive to be Yuuko) was in theory, a victim of the school’s curse. Coincidentally, the place where Yuuko’s remains are situated, looks eerily like a shrine. Teiichi notices the interrelation of the stories (the mystery behind the mirror, the ghost that takes students away, and now the shrine mystery) presents the idea that the “mysteries” and ghost stories could all possibly be cover-ups for some greater mystery – most likely the truth of what really happened to Yuuko."

Part of it was that I was wanting a pair of straight-legs with a more interesting wash than my Joe's jeans, and part of it was that I just really liked the cut of these.

And I was right! Take that, twiggy!"

"Overall the gross enrolment rate in higher education in India is still less than 15 per cent. These figures show significant disparities across class, caste, gender and region. It is also less than the world average of 23 per cent. Secondly, despite the government’s constant pledge to raise public spending in education to at least 6 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), public spending on education still remains at less than 4 per cent of GDP. This is much lower than the share in a number of developing countries. The average share of higher education in the total education expenditure of both Central and State governments has come down from 14 percent during 1981-82 to 1991-92 to 12.7 percent during 1992-93 to 2003-04."

Once again in the ‘80’s however, we saw the emergence of a super camp – the Santa Monica Track Club. Under the tutelage of Tom Tellez we witnessed the development of Carl Lewis, Leroy Burrell, Joe DeLoach, and Mike Marsh, et al – and a climb back to the top of the world’s elite and international podiums."

"A recent Wall Street Journal Report indicates that American men in their 30's are making less money than their fathers did at the same age (adjusted for the cost of living).

If that helps the GOP nominee, so much the better.

"If there is anything potentially more embarrassing than, say, the admission of a amorous proclivity for farm animals, it's the confession that I play the clarinet. In the early 1960s, it seems, the clarinet, easily portable and more abundant than tympani or sousaphone, was the instrument of choice for families who had children in Los Angeles County schools. There were three sections of clarinets in band--adding up to more than 20 musicians--compared with the random bassoonist or trio of euphonium players. For a boy who measured his entire life on being mentally and bodily different from his fellows, the clarinet promised little more than anonymity and an opportunity to create screeching sounds that would scare off all sentient creatures with ears."

Incorporating RIM’s security and acquisitions they’ve made, we could see RIM being a leader in the NFC field when it comes to payments, electronic entry to buildings, etc etc. Even through its new peripheral device – the BlackBerry Music Gateway announced at BB World 2012, RIM is showing that they are serious about the potential of NFC when it comes to sharing content, pairing devices and much much more."

"So unless you are very clear about the distinction between ego and Authentic Self, you can assume that you are intuiting all kinds of things and ascribe to them tremendous significance, when actually they are just the voice of the individual and collective ego. Unless we get over our ego-driven narcissism, the whole notion of intuition can become very tangled up with our already over-exaggerated sense of self-importance and with all the excessive significance we tend to give to our feelings and our personal story. If we’re not awake to this, we can easily end up deluding ourselves and misleading others with our so-called spiritual intuitions."

"If you don’t put the hours in, you won’t be able to do the routines. Gymnastics is a tough sport. One wrong move and you can get an injury that can take you out for months, if not years. In order to work up to the more complicated moves you need to spend time in the gym, nailing down each move before you try the next. In this particular case, (as in most other cases) practice does make perfect. If you don’t spend the time doing the work, you won’t ever improve."

"There is another aspect to these calls for ‘Bengal’.This one jives very well with that snazziness that shining India is all about – ‘Brand Bengal’ as it is called in the chambers of commerce and in the upmarket cafes of Kolkata. Some of this is the upwardly mobile upper middle class with its ‘consumer product’ centric view of all things. Then there is the element of supposed ‘coolness’ of ‘Bengal’ vis-à-vis the vernacular. Whats more, it even reeks of the nostalgia of stolen Burma teak, lazy colonial evenings and a booming Calcutta port to drain away surplus. The over bearing presence of the Calcutta-centric ( not Kolkata-centric) discourse on the question of renaming West Bengal did serve to skew the public. To some inhabitants of Calcutta, whose ‘Bengal’ or ‘West Bengal’ do not stretch beyond the confines of the metropolis (except a flight to Darjeeling). They are very perturbed about the discomfiture that foreigners (read inhabitants of Western Europe and USA) would endure pronounce this new name. If they had half the empathy for their fellow beings just beyond their city compared to what they have for folks who live half a world away, may be they would have better appreciated the importance of ‘West’ in ‘West Bengal’. Their lived reality remains utterly divorced from the sensitivities of the matuas and other low-caste communities who migrated from East Bengal and have trans-border organic connections in terms of family ties and pilgrimages. Slicing off references to ‘West’ would have been a project of cleavage – especially ironic in the face of officially sanctioned joint-exercises ( the drill-sounding expression is used intentionally) between India and Bangladesh using Rabindranath Thakur’s 150th birth anniversary as the reason.This, at the same time when, poor Bengalis in either Bengal, are continuously harassed and belittled by immigration functionaries and East Bengalis are gunned down at the Indian Republican frontier by Government of India’s Border Security Force at a disturbingly regular interval.That the killing of East Bengalis does not evoke any serious reaction in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, might suggest that the time has indeed come to drop the ‘West’ in West Bengal, as its mandarins show not a shred of sympathy to its brothers and sisters to the east. But there may be hope still."

"1. Positive, Negative, Positive: As a college student at one of the top art colleges in the country, I had to participate regularly in critiques. One of the most valuable lessons I learned in critiques was how to critique a classmate in a way that wouldn’t offend him/her. Simply put, always start with a positive. Nobody wants to hear somebody slam something they’ve done right off the bat. If you proceed your criticism with a positive, and immediately follow the criticism with another positive, the blow will be much easier to hear and digest. The listener won’t be so eager to defend him/herself and their work, but will be more willing to listen."

The streets were particularly empty, yet filled with music, as we walked that night because most of the town was at a wedding a few roads up on the small mountain.

"I texted my husband “Pecan Pie or Pumpkin Cheesecake” and got the reply text “Pecan!” So I searched the Internet for a pecan pie recipe and found this one, which I modified a bit. Most of the recipes I found called for Karo corn syrup, but this one uses brown and white sugar instead. It turned out great! It had all the wonderful pecan flavor without that sticky too-sweet quality that a lot of pecan pies have. Since I truly love pecans, I increased the amount of pecans in the recipe, and to make it a bit decorative added the pecan halves to the top. Also, since I usually have dark brown sugar in the cupboard I used that instead of the light brown sugar the original recipe called for."

I understand it may work in other countries, where Janice was never so popular. But here in North America, it wouldn’t work. I’m sorry Janus.

"Try to alter your expectations, hopes and dreams for your children away from specific “head” topics – college, degree, marriage, money – and into looser “heart” ones, like happiness, peace, love, and passion. Because our expectations manifest themselves in ways that are visible to our children, “head” expectations are likely to push them down the path toward pre-defined traditional education choices and careers, with fewer opportunities for radically different choices. But “heart” expectations can take many guises. These types of expectations could lead them to college and corporate career, to be sure; but it is far more likely that this would be a path of their choosing as opposed to a path of convenience. It could also lead them to travel the world. It could lead them to a quiet career in the arts, or an “out loud” life doing things that we – and they – cannot even imagine yet. In other words, it can help them view their lives as ones of freedom and choice in which success is defined on their own terms and in their own time. It can help them see what it possible, rather than what is impossible or pre-ordained. And it can help them see that success when defined by the heart is more lasting and joyful than when defined by the head."

New books about growing and changing had been placed on the children's bookshelves. The titles focused on:
"I didn’t really see any students react or cry if they did not get in. There was one student who I’m pretty sure did not get into Inagakuen, and her mother seemed more upset then she was. The girl looked up at the sign, and just seemed to nod silently. her mother was carrying a baby, and handed the baby off to the grandmother so she could take out her handkerchief and dab her eyes."
"Rather what we are seeing is that those whose fingers are being proverbially chopped for corruption are still acquiring diamond rings. An open letter to President Jonathan by Fitch, Fitch, Fitch and Associates at The Hague, Netherlands on behalf of Transparency International says it all:"
"But, the kids and husband and I have been doing more together, some games and movie watching. 2010 sucks as far as finances, relying on vehicals and my job just not being what i would like, but, at least my children are happy and healthy, my animals are happy and healthy and we aren't homeless....always have to look on the bright side!"

I will end this post with a comment I overheard from a 10 year old girl (sounds like a future feminist no doubt):
"Boston’s real name is Yul Styles-Lyons and she believed he loved her. After more than a month without contacting family, she called mom to say she had a new love and everything was going to be OK."
"It was also my first try at hand quilting a quilt. I love the look and how it turned out, so I'm sure that I'll give it another try on a future quilt. For me, that's what's great about these swap groups. It gives me a chance to try out a new technique or idea on a small project and I get to make someone else happy with something made especially for them."
"Both, actually. Mostly I simply start writing from a title, a character or just a vague idea and see where it leads me. Sometimes the beginning and the end are already set in my head when I start. It's rare that I have a whole story before I begin, but it does happen."

"Quick, in what year is this movie set? Hard isn’t it? Could be 1927, could be forty years later. It is 1959, Welton’s centennial. 1959 is an interesting choice; a few years earlier and the 1960s, which Keating some sort of harbinger of, would seem too far away. A few years later, and the boys’ initial conformity would seem unbelievably square. So really, this is a story that seems sort of out of time, but really it’s hard to imagine it happening in any other year."
"The weather forecast threatens more rain tomorrow, which I hope will subside before the afternoon, as I plan to visit Jardin Japonese and Jardin Zoologico. Wouldn't be much fun in the freezing rain or wind. And in any case, I will be more prepared for the weather tomorrow! First thing I will buy in the morning will be a thermos and a set of Yerba Mate. I think I've grown addicted to the bitter stuff, and I can't wait to have my own thermos to carry around like those old men of Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile."
"The registration desk in the morning isn't exactly thronging with eager congress-goers. Must have picked up their materials yesterday. At the Group Photo on the spacious front steps of the convention center there's room for a serious convention, but only 60 or so people show up. Who bothers with these things anyway? YJB isn't here. Somebody else figures the photo is for invited speakers only. Ah, yes, must be it. Only the elite."
"That lady came out to my house from DHS. Yep, she remembered today. She wasn’t as young as I thought she was–she just seems to naturally have one of those bubbly personalities. She was fat. Why does that matter? Cuz I knew I didn’t have to fucking worry about her judging me solely on weight. With this being a state agency and being told up front that obtaining a chore worker is almost impossible anymore…..I fully expected to be denied. I also knew having this visit was just one more step in the process. I wasn’t sure how much more red tape was left. To my ultimate surprise the home visit was very painless. It was embarrassing talking about some issues but I was honest with her. At the end of the visit I was totally SHOCKED when she told me I qualify for EVERYTHING—you heard that right! They will pay for someone to come cook, and do light house cleaning including laundry & vacuuming, grocery shopping, driving me to doctors apt etc. I could NOT believe it. She said they will pay out about 800-900 per month to someone to help me. I can hire my own person or agency for this. She said it does NOT matter at all who the person is. She said she hates to say this but in training they told her, it could even be a murderer cuz as far as the state is concerned—I am the employer NOT them—they just help me pay the person. I would feel more comfortable with someone I knew helping me but since I don’t know anyone, I’m just going to have to get over it. I was trying to think who in my family I could employ but they live too far away and the able-bodied ones are…..well too lazy and not dependable. I would like to talk to some other people. She told me to call her tomorrow if i couldn’t think of anyone. I would MUCH rather have an individual than a company considering how unpredictable my illness is. A person would be flexible than a company would be–this was even per the DHS worker. She said if I need ANYTHING at all to call her. She also told me if it would help get DH off my back, they could pay him for the time he helped me starting from when my doctor signed that form to the time I hire someone else. (I never told him about this part LOL). I asked her what to do when I get super bad episodes where I can’t take care of DD. She said she wasn’t sure off the top of her head but she would check into it. She also told me that I had NO worries about DD being taken away from me over any of this—which was a major concern for me. She said she use to work in foster care and protective services."

I don’t think we played a bad show the whole tour—the 8 piece band sounded like a 747 landing on your house."

"Just when the fruits were still green on the outside was the best times to eat those. Fresh from the trees. We did not even bother cutting the fruits up. Usually I liked it best with just a bit of salt. We bit into one, dipped into a bit of salt and finished each one that way. However, it was bad time to pick these fruits up, if of course you wanted them to ripen, which my grandmother did earnestly. There was an eternal battle between us kids and my grandparents. We tried our best to get to the fruits and my grandparents tried their best to protect them. There were no winners or losers in the end. We did munch away to glory to Guavas, that we often ended up 'stealing' with a bit of salt, a lot of laughter and amidst tales of who was the bravest and who ended up stealinst the best fruit."

"Once again, injuries had trimmed our eighteen man squad down to twelve fit players. Many of us arrived in the new Burridge tracksuits which club manager, Paul Dyke, had bought for just over a £100. I too had worn mine. It's a navy blue two piece shell suit made by Jani, which no doubt alerted the suspicion of the security guard inside Tesco on Burgess Road, when I stopped in for a Lucozade. Back in my car I heard a nasty ripping sound coming from the stitching in the garment's shoulder when I reached over to my glove compartment. Fortunately, no damage appears to have been done."

"I am an Americorp VISTA volunteer with Manatee Reads! formerly The Literacy Council of Manatee County. I’m originally from Western Massachusetts, and when we came to Florida, we became exposed to a wide diversity of cultures and food. After my husband passed away, I heard that volunteering combats depression. I was still working, and work was ok, but boy, when the weekends came, I found I couldn’t wait for Monday again. I had no purpose. Someone suggested the literacy council, and I thought why not, I could teach someone to read. I mean, all I had to do was give my time. So I signed up. I had volunteered before, but this time I was going to be my own boss and volunteer on my terms, weekends only! You know how they say, “things happen for a reason”; well, they were looking for just what I had to offer. Fancy that! After meeting with the director and going through the training, I was hooked. I could tutor right before NASCAR racing, or just before NFL kickoff. It turned out that what helped me was helping to make a difference in other peoples’ lives and in the community."

The slowdown is largely explained by a substantial drop in grants at the patent offices of the Republic of Korea (-32.5%).

"Even more importantly, the concept of deviant globalization has important things to say about what policy-makers should NOT do. Above all, policy-makers should avoid indulging locally specific moral codes, since that simply creates arbitrage opportunities for bad actors.

"Another show conveniently one block from my flat, another night of overpowering paranoia preventing me from walking out the door until I had missed almost the whole show. I got inside just about half way through the Fleshies set, but didn't escape paying the door charge this time. Right as I walked in, John Geek landed at my feet, and I shouldn't have been surprised to find him at least 20 from the stage. He wasn't even close to being naked though. The Fleshies had always been my favourite of the East Bay poppier punk bands that were playing during my early years of living in Oakland, and I hadn't seen them in awhile. It felt good. Like a familiar old uncle's hand down your pants."
"Hearing loss is – as we might expect – invisible. Jacques Derrida’s Memoirs of the Blind, however, is an account, based on many works in the Louvre, of sighted artists’ images of blindness. But how can we convey the sound of deafness? The ecstatic and angular final works of Beethoven (such as the late string quartets, the Diabelli Variations and Piano Sonata no. 32 in C minor, op. 111) are astonishing achievements in abstraction and testaments to the visuality of musical composition, but how would a hearing composer denote a deaf world? Perhaps they can’t and don’t need to, for if the human sensorium is a gestalt, and a change in one part of it changes the whole, we might expect that when one door of perception closes another opens: blind poets and musicians from Homer to Stevie Wonder have been celebrated and admired. Perhaps their courage and intensity of truth-saying is something we – sighted or not, deaf or not – might learn from as we all try to make the best of our limitations and losses."

"Seeing is the dominant sense visual learners use. They learn best by looking, reading, and writing things down. In contrast to auditory learners, visual learners tend to focus on the visual component of the lecture such as highlighted terms or diagrams rather than what the instructor is saying.

I wanted to be able to file pictures away and know exactly where they were.

But most of all, I wanted to be able to keep these memories from getting wrinkled, torn and ruined from lack of organization."

"Another relatively recent development that merits consideration here (and not only within ‘reserved’ Asian cultures) is the application of neuroscience and biometric methods. Although still debated within MR circles, these methods can overcome some of the problems associated with direct questioning. Nevertheless, a potential drawback is scalability in large, lower cost markets with weaker technical infrastructures. Currently, EEG or galvanic skin response measures are relatively costly to implement and technically complex."

Neither Coe, Bubka, nor Juantorena could single handedly get the job done here, in the same way that they have been able to do in their own countries. Our challenges are daunting, our demographics very different. We require the collective work of our best – and I belive that this model would provide that."

"In the next couple of weeks I will be making a minor contribution to a television series that is intending to plot the evolution of our daily meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is very familiar territory to me, as in 2000, together with art historians Peter Brown, Andrew Moore and Gillian Riley, I curated the major travelling exhibition Eat, Drink and Be Merry, which surveyed the development of the English table and our meals in great detail through major paintings and the decorative arts. We recreated dinners, suppers, breakfasts and teatimes from many different periods using original tableware, silver, porcelain and glass as well as food. Just for the record I have not seen anything yet that matches the scope and vision of that exhibition in any of the British TV programmes that have so far touched on food history.

And my mom can't take any vacation in December. But she wanted to go at Christmas time. So we were going Nov 10-17th. Parks are all decked out by then, so it was good. Hubby did not have that vacation though. He can probably get it. At his job, vacation is assigned...you get it when they give it to you...and his vacation is actually the last week of Nov and first of Dec. So since it's just us, we switched it to then..and a Wed-Wed to save on airfare. If my parents can go..we'll just switch the dates back. No biggie. (Hopefully)"

I called my mom, and she took me to the emergency room, where she made sure I told everyone how I had hurt myself. (My mother has a strict no lying/no stealing policy). Much to my dismay, the (hot, young) doctor told me I had indeed sprained my neck (betcha didn't even think that was possible) and that I would need to wear a neck brace for a week. I had to go back to work like that, where I obviously couldn't tell people what had really happened but didn't want to lie (moms get in your head that way). I mean, if you say you were in a car accident or something...and karma hears you...well, you know."

Since I have really oily skin here in the humid equator, most of my collection of BB Creams are stronger on the oil control factor. When I came across the Lioele Water Drop BB Cream at JL one evening, I was sold by the pretty blue packaging, quite different from their usual line of pink princessy packaging.

"So after letting the month of January pass us by, we finally set something up with a local photographer who took pictures for my cousin's wedding and did a fabulous job so I figured we'd give her a try. We went to her home where she has a studio and tried to get some family shots as well as individual pictures of the kids but it was chaos! No one wanted to cooperate and after two hours of pure hell, we were hoping something decent came out of the shoot. When we got home from the photo shoot, there was a message from the photographer. Turns out the memory card the pictures were taken on was corrupt so all of those images that were so painstakingly taken were lost! I was quite disappointed but quickly remembered that the shoot did not go as well as we had hoped so Tiffany, the photographer, said she would shoot them again free of charge once the weather got nicer outside, where we all hoped they would be more cooperative!"

Last semester, I stood face-to-face with Southern-rock god and influential storyteller, Mike Cooley from the Drive-by Truckers. He was wandering around downtown Tuscaloosa before DBT’s show back in September of last year. I was standing outside Rooster’s Blues House with my manager, Scott, handing out flyers to passer-bys when Cooley walked up. There I was, all googly-eyed and unable to utter a sound except for a barely audible “Hi.” I stared and smiled as he talked with Scott about the night’s show (see, Rooster’s hosted the DBT show at the Bama Theatre. I felt honored). Eventually, Cooley heads off and I wave goodbye, regretting my inability to ask for his autograph. Scott didn’t even realize who he had been talking to for the past three minutes. Of course I made sure to fill him in, including my confession of obsession. I’m still mad at myself to this day. I didn’t look cool. I just looked crazy."

"The apartment building was another upscale one, under lock and key. We got buzzed in and entered the compound. It is one of those places that strives to be modern in its appearance. I don’t like it. It tried to hard to be modern and in the atempt it looked tacky and had a cold, impersonal feeling. Large walls baracaded the residents into a secluded world of unnecessary beams, odd architecure that did not serve any purpose and lonely, impersonal doors that led to the apartment/compartments that housed people’s esxistence. No one has yards, everyone is boxed into their secluded place and your entire life may go unkown to an outsider until someone comes by to collect your junk. I don’t like the place."

"I told her just what I had seen and she assured me that life in that house was simply unbearable on account of that same old lady. She said an old woman, the exact counterpart of the one I described, had owned the house years ago and had been murdered by her son-in-law, who secured a large sum of money that she had secreted in the house. He burned her body in the cellar and it had lain there for years until the bones were finally discovered by some men digging in the cellar. As the family were all dead nothing could be done toward bringing the murderer to justice. Ever since the discovery of the bones the house had been haunted by the woman’s ghost. Doors were slammed and opened, locks were unlocked, windows were rattled and unearthly groans heard. She said she had moved into the house only five days before, but, although she had paid a month’s rent in advance, she would lose that and move out."""
"So some days are good. And then, often without warning, some days are bad. Today hit me like a truck.

"The ‘as’ here has particular meaning (as opposed to using the word ‘in’). As implies a ‘way of life’, a ‘point of view’, it implies action on the part of the person living the life. It implies there is a indistinguishable relationship between the person living the life and the life that is being lived – they mutually create and shape one another. If we used the word ‘in’, then it implies that where one lives is independent of the person living the life – like some independent place that exists from its own side. That is a false conception of things."

I enjoyed this laugh and better than that she gave me a beer. If I wasn’t going to get a good time I was at least going to enjoy the rest of my run.

"It is critical to the successful integration of the site with the rest of Lower Manhattan that Dey and Cortlandt Streets be extended as real streets between Church and Greenwich. These streets must be designed to accommodate both vehicular and pedestrian use. The public realm in New York is primarily composed of streets and sidewalks. As such, Dey and Cortlandt provide key opportunities to expand the amount of open space and accessibility into the site. Furthermore, these streets will ensure that the typical block size along Church Street remains the same as the blocks to the north and south. In New York, with few exceptions, larger block sizes (for example, blocks as long as the dimension between Liberty and Dey Streets) are provided only for our most significant public buildings such as Grand Central Station."
"“Stray Cat Blues” is a deliciously sleazy song, crawling with decadence and sexual debauchery. It’s about a rock musician who has sex with an admittedly underage groupie, and considers it “no hanging matter” and “no capital crime.” It’s spoken in the second person from the rock star to the girl. Now, it’s not a story of the two having sex, and then the rock star finding out after the fact that the girl lied about her age, the rocker regretful that he’s landed in jail. The fact that the girl is only 15 is out in the open. It ups the sleaze to about five times its normal amount."

"So no wonder I've been pulling away. Not wanting to hear completely unnecessary (and frankly very offensive) commiserations. Not wanting to hear ignorant comments about the perceived nature of ALL children with Down as if they are completely ruled and determined by this one extra chromosome and not in the least the 46 others. Not wanting to hear one more time how especially courageous we are, when courage has nothing to do with having a child with Down and everything to do with just having a child. Not wanting to explain time and time again how our daughter will have a full range of emotions from that humongo-tantrum-enraging anger to giddy happy hysterics (if she's anything like me that will be the scale), the ability to learn and develop like any other child (even if that development will happen somewhat more slowly in her case), and a bright future ahead of her with friends, education, coffee, jobs, boyfriends (or girlfriends should she be so inclined), and all that which comes with growing up. And most of all, not wanting to justify my joy and happiness for this, the approaching birth of my first child, my daughter, who I thought had already disappeared from my deck of cards, nor justify my deepest desire for her to pull through the misery the placenta is currently being held responsible for and arrive here safely, just the way she is."
Another example: say for instance the biggest fear of a Black Government is a White Right-wing backlash. What do they need to do?

Amused, I responded: Arrested for what? Because of liberal politicians you support, we can’t even profile at the airport or engage in “warrantless wiretapping” or engage in any other preventative measure to capture radical Islamic terrorists. We need to wait until they’ve actually blown up an airplane or building before we do anything.

I knew she hadn't, her parking spot is right in front of my patio, and I noticed she never went out. I didn't care.

It's actually a lot easier than it seems, much like colorful haired girls to guys with equally colorful and huge hair."
"I imagine it would be a fascinating sight to witness the formation of planets and we get such a small glimpse in Genesis chapter one. God, in one chapter, forms all of the physical world and as we read, we don’t often realize this, but we are witnesses to this from a perspective along side the creator; this does not happen very often."

"Having recently become a resident of the Hythe I must admit it is a far more appealing place to find yourself in; a variety of new build homes, a river and even a riverside bar take the place of Greenstead’s sprawling concrete jungle council estate. With the Hythe not only do you get niceties, you get convenience thrown in with the mix too. Not only are you still in short strolling distance of campus and Tesco, Hythe is in much greater proximity to town, leaving a journey that is within walking distance. This allows you to avoid the unpredictable and consistently awful traffic, that after two years of living in Colchester I myself have grown to loathe."

"So what it comes down to is, it’s our problem. It’s our fault for anything untrue we see on television for we demand it. And if you want to see some change away from this untruth we have engulfed ourselves into, maybe next time we stop on a “reality” television show (such as Gene Simmons Family Jewels) we should lift our finger and change the channel. Or better yet, turn off the TV and find your own reality. It’s as simple as that. Click!"

One of the waitresses comes back to the kitchen with an obnoxiously complicated order for “a kid”. Why, whomever could that be? Hilariously, Mildred immediately realizes Veda must have arrived, and she takes off her apron and goes out to say hello to her and Bert. Bert congratulates her sincerely, and then Wally shows up to tell Mildred he did a direct mailing about the restaurant to every name on the old Pierce Homes list. Marketing, how exciting. And then Bert brings up some fire insurance thing, to make this scene even duller."

"One of the CC things I bought (well, several) was the Snowman products, all of them, CD's and stamps, they are fab, so fab in fact that I had to use them to make something really special. So armed with a tutorial that Sara Davies did on the CC forum during birthday week, I made 24 individual slider boxes and then stuck them all together and created this. I've wanted to do one of these for ages but until I saw the tutorial (using the ultimate pro) I didn't know how to make the slider boxes, but they are soo easy, it was great. All of the papers used on the advent calendar are from CC as well, and of course the gorgeous snowmen stamps, and to top it off, I used my CC Spectrum Noirs to colour the images."

Hello and happy Friday to everyone!
Even the kids see the association. It was funny at first but now I’m starting to feel it’s all a little sad. I don't want to turn into a bag lady. I started buying boxes instead of bottles. It didn’t look quite so desperate (or was it because it hid how much I was drinking?) But then I realised I could get through a box of wine in three to four days. It’s too easy to keep topping up with a box. And it was even more of a shock when I calculated how many units are in a box. Mum’s psychological crutch had increased to a bottle of wine a night. How shocking is that?

Of course, many of them had eyes on her because she is young and so adorable. It freaked Emy out to say the least. For the rest of the night she sat in my lap and refused to even walk through the dining room without being carried. She was terrified. I hope she does not carry this fear with her throughout her life like people do with a fear of clowns."

"I should have known there was a problem with my image following my first televised appearance in about 1968. My Professor had been asked to make a programme about various forms of hair loss, and so I, as the bright young spark and general dogsbody of the Department, had been asked to gather together suitable patients and demonstrate the various features of their different diseases in the clinic, whilst my Professor spoke about the science of hair follicles from the studio."

This is, as Teague Egan would say, “crucial, brah” because it will still foster the kinds of circular, pointless debates ESPN gets off on (and frankly milks for 24 hours so they have content) by debating who the final 2-3 teams that get in are, but it will not be as passionate a fight as a four team will create."

"The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of goods that need delivering. But empty trailers just take up road space and fuel. uShip hooks up people who need to make a delivery with transporters who are in the area. As the A&E show Shipping Wars (which uses uShips services) showed, the best transporters will pick up extra loads on the way to another delivery. It lines their pockets, and also means another truck won’t waste time and fuel to pick up that package."
"I still remember vividly as a beginner, sitting and sitting and sitting, and being told to smile and smile and smile until I thought that my face would crack into a million fissures. I am back there. I had better luck at the traditional milongas. Spent hours sitting at Villa Malcolm, danced only with Sorin, and could not get a cabeceo returned to save my life. I thought about trying to cabeceo cross eyed for the last hour. Maybe that would make a difference. I was sitting with a new friend, and she managed to cabeceo a guy whom I could not get to hold my glance if I had sent up a flare and stripped to my panties. Don't get me wrong, I truly was thrilled for her, it was her first cabeceo, and it made her night. But that was the last straw for me. My fissures were showing."

They also remind me how small I am, how small the concerns and worries that I carry in my daily living are and how much, for even a brief moment, I want to be part of the beautiful symphony playing itself out before me. It turns out – I can be – and you can be too. These moments are a gift from the Creator to remind us of who we are and to invite us to be co-creators by joining in."

"There is a question Claire has long been asking: why do vampires live so far out in a sunny desert when they’re sensitive to sunlight? The reason doesn’t have to do with sunlight but water – and an ancient enemy who has finally found a way to invade the vampires’ landlocked community. Vampires aren’t the top predator on earth. There’s something worse that preys on them …something much worse. Which means if Claire, and Morganville, want to live, they will have to fight on to the last breath."
"The story begins with Marlowe helping a stranger named Terry Lennox. They strike up a brief acquaintance. One morning Lennox appears on the detective’s doorstep and asks for assistance. Marlowe helps him flee the country, an action that makes him an unwitting accessory in the murder of Lennox’s wife. Soon after Lennox’s flight, Marlowe hears news of his suicide. The twists and turns of the plot are especially gripping since Marlowe is personally involved in the case. His life is continually at risk."
"This whole week has been a whirlwind full of things, things, and more things.

"Finally, I jumped up, ready to do battle. Unfortunately, I couldn't think of a single weapon that would be useful while he held the upper ground. I did consider getting the broom from the pantry, but that would require leaving my reconnaissance post, and that would have been completely unacceptable. After all, who would be left to guard my bedroom doorway if I went AWOL? We all know that a renegade spider loose in the bedroom may be the only thing worse than one loose in the bathroom. I quickly took my eyes from the enemy just long enough to perform a sweeping search of the available weaponry, and I found a small pile of ponytail holders in reach. AHA!"

"You see, it goes both ways. Women are scrutinized for being too heavy, but they’re also scrutinized for being too thin. I’m proud of all of the “embrace your curves” movements going on out there, but too often those images of beautiful, curvy women are next to images of very thin women with a caption that says something to the effect of ”I’d rather be curvy than look anorexic.” Granted, many of those pictures show a thin woman that looks obviously unhealthy, and I know it’s meant to comment on the pressure women are under to be dangerously thin, but is that actually the message that comes across? To me, it says that you love your body, but … what? “Ew, that skinny girl is gross?”"

"Not all the ground is well-trod, either. Conquest is, for example, the only Méliès film I’ve seen with a subplot: in this case involving a group of suffragettes (played, without sympathy, by burly women) who demand to join the trip. Méliès also tinkers with his dramatic structure, allowing his lead aeronaut, Professor Crazyloft, to treat his guests, and us, to a demonstration of how the craft will fly, using a scale model. (In keeping with Méliès’ dubious commitment to physics, this demo justifies nothing we’ll see later on, but it does make certain scenes more logical.) He also films one of Conquest’s automobile sequences outdoors--rare for this director--though the car is repainted to match Méliès’ cartooned hyper-reality. There’s even a brief closeup, late in the film."
"“Exactly. And then if a campaign should finally catch fire and start exploding on you, all of a sudden you start to condescend and rip into us for lack of decorum. Decorum. Hah!” Matt laughed loudly. Heads turned. “On the one hand, you want democracy to be a great popular sport, everybody involved and cheering wildly. But as soon as it starts to happen, you’re horrified. It’s like you want everybody to come to the party but only if they dress just so. You complain about how nobody votes anymore. Big deal! Ninety percent of the people in Italy vote. You want a country like that? And all this BS about how television ads are ruining campaigns! You know why editorial writers don’t like television spots? Because they take power out of their hands! They want a few dinky debates, a polite campaign, and then for everybody to sit at home on Sunday waiting for the editorials to know which way to vote. Instead, some jerk like me can muck things up! You want twenty percent of the people to vote instead of fifty! Just take campaign commercials off the air. You’ll bore everybody to death!”"

I’m not sure if it’s because I’d seen it before, or if I’m just tired of “old” movies, or if I wasn’t looking forward to watching another movie with a little kid as one of the main characters, or some other reason altogether. Whatever it was, there was definitely some kind of mental block that was just making me not want to watch it. Part of it may be that, since I’m still only halfway through Danse Macabre, and the next book I’m reading also doesn’t have a movie associated with it, there just wasn’t any sense of urgency involved."

To place vintage stamps -- assuming their denominations are all between 1-30 cents -- you will need a huge envelope to get to the total you need to mail one invite. And remember that an oversized envelope will also add to the price of mailing.

"Without getting into the pros and cons of Brewery Tap Contracts here, it must be said that owner and Chef Mark Mills is doing all he can to bring a range of good beer to his country clientele. In what can be described as a fruitful partnership with Lion Nathan’s Paul Mitchem, The Plough has a commercial tap arrangement with the big brewer which sees everything from Boag’s Draught and Beck’s to James Squire Pilsner and Hahn White rotating through taps that once saw just two mainstream brands poured."

"I began noticing that people would not talk to me when I talked to them, and they’d move away quickly. Someone would talk about me and say nasty things in front of my face. I would go into the lunchroom and try to sit next to a co-worker, and told the seat was for someone else. And then I’d watch as no one filled the seat. When I would walk through the parking lot, construction workers would pass by me and give me very creepy looks. This was done by all the men, not one. I thought it was strange, but I dismissed their looks. I began to notice that anytime anything happened at work, it was always my fault. When I went to lunch in the restaurant located in the building, no one would come out to serve me lunch. Or if they came out to help, they would rudely talk to me, and sloppily serve me food."

In several clear, convincing chapters they explain the nature of exponential and combinatorial technologies and the ways in which they can spread and change. It is not just the presence of our current technologies, but the ways in which they lay the groundwork for future technologies, that makes this moment so important."

"When we sighted the copper dome of the Baths, Brett headed directly for the front entrance. Yes, the entrance opposite of the entrance we (I) had read about for days. I informed Brett we needed to go to the back entrance otherwise my extensive knowledge and research on entrance to the baths would be in vain. He did not want to use that entrance. Why? Because he is stubborn. He asked me why we couldn’t use the front entrance. I did not say it was because I am also stubborn. I just told him I didn’t know how to use the front entrance. It sounded lame to me, too. We went in the front entrance and paid for our admission without issue. Then, we looked around. We asked an attendant where we were supposed to go. She said the various rooms were full. That was fine…we didn’t want any fancy, indoor thermal baths. We wanted the big, familiar, outdoor pool-sized baths thatwere outlined in the book! She told us to go to the back entrance."

The meals we make and the snacks in our cupboard are changed. Our food bill has fluctuated based on our educated choices. And, even our dinner table discussions and television programming have been altered. We are different – there is no way around that. I questioned (well, fretted) over how Andrew would react to these changes. With an ordinary, “one-week maximum stay” kind of houseguest, I would take the not so delicate approach of “suck it up”. You are a guest in my house and you will eat the food that we prepare. You will live like a Ferry. I don’t need a smile, but I expect respect."

"About a year ago, it was suggested to me by my supervisor at Staff Development for Educators (SDE) that I try to develop some STEM projects for my class and try to include them in some of the sessions that I present at their conferences. (For a complete list of my upcoming presentations, please click here!) My first thought was, “Uh... why would I want to teach about stem cells in Kindergarten?” And then my next question was, “What is STEM?” (Unfortunately, this only revealed my own ignorance in the subject, LOL!) For those of you that are still in the dark regarding this topic like I was, the term “STEM” in relation to edu-speak refers to projects that integrate all four of these subjects: science, technology, engineering, and math. Hence the term, STEM! So for the purpose of this blog post, this discussion has NOTHING to do with stem cells at all, thankfully! And as far as the “engineering” part of it is concerned, all the children have to do is simply build something. SO..., in this project, they would need to use the scientific method, and perhaps hypothesize, predict, conclude, etc. They would need to use technology in it somehow, such as a camera, iPad, document camera, etc. They would need to build something, or try to “invent” something. And then they would need to use their math skills somehow, by counting, estimating, sorting, dividing (sharing equally), etc. According to SDE, there is grant money out there for teachers that create STEM projects! Hmm, very interesting!!! Now I just need to figure out where to apply for it!!!!"

"@Windaddict's/@hopsafari declared this dish to be his favorite dessert of all time. This is Chef Philip's take on the Wendy's Frosty with Fries. It isn't a secret that I'm a lover of the Wendy's Frosty, and this dessert really knocks it out of the park. A french fry cream borders the outside of the dish that is topped with a variety of sweet soils. On top of that is a aerated and dehydrated chocolate shake topped with a creamy sorbet. Many of Chef Philip's desserts require that you eat all of the components together. When you eat each one of these components together, you'll get a time warp back to your childhood of fries in ice cream. You might even be doing it as an adult. Have no shame. Chef Philip doesn't."

We like an idea we got from Pinterest…make mini meat loaves to serve as individual servings which is great for portion control. They are easy to store in the freezer and pull out and reheat and serve. There are two ways to try. The first is to press the meatloaf mixture into a muffin pan. Bake time is reduced to 25 minutes but be sure the internal temp is 160° F. The other method is to use a larger pan then divide your raw mixture in a grid separating into mini meat loaf portions. Bake time is also reduced for this method. Just search Mini Meat Loaves on Pinterest for plenty of ideas!

"I started the day with LEAVE ME LIKE YOU FOUND ME, which would make an interesting pseudo-sequel to THE LONELIEST PLANET, at least in as much as they're both about couples walking in the wilderness. But while THE LONELIEST PLANET featured a recently engaged couple with a love that gets tested, LEAVE ME LIKE YOU FOUND ME features a couple that has broken up before and is (for some reason) trying to get back together. What it illustrates better than anything is why they broke up--they had gotten to the point where they knew how to push all of each other's buttons, but didn't have the willpower to refrain from doing so. Well, they still don't, but they're still attracted to each other. So they go on a camping trip in Sequoia National Park, where they alternately fuck and fight in the woods--sometimes within minutes of each. It's very well made, the two leads (Megan Boone and David Nordstrom) do a fine job, and it's a believable portrait of a possible resurrection of a relationship that maybe should stay dead. But pretty quickly into it I kind of stopped caring about them and whether these two kind of annoying and selfish people would find happiness together. At one point, they get lost in the woods as night falls. I confess I was hoping they would stay lost and the movie would end with them dying in the woods, dehydrated and not talking to each other. I'm not sure if that's because I disliked them, just didn't care about them, or just desperately hoped for some drama. Spoiler alert: No such luck."

Distance runners get to run relays with 4 x 800, distance medleys, and even 4 x 1600. Field event competitors too, with long jump, high jump, shot put, and discus relays (and others) where the marks of four competitors are totaled together to determine a team winner.

By Saturday 11th June, however, it was time to get back on the tourist trail so we got ourselves into downtown Vancouver (via the magnificent Seabus that crosses the water between North Vancouver and its southern cousin). There we saw for ourselves the (ice) hockey fever that had a hold of the city thanks to the Stanley Cup. Ice-hockey is Canada’s national sport pretty much and Vancouver’s team, the Canucks, was several matches into a play-off set of finals against the Boston Bruins. We also saw an electric car fair down near the Science Centre, a lot of people on bikes and skates as well as the annual Dragonboats races out on False Creek (take a look at the map – Vancouver is surrounded by many different bodies of water). Mark saw straightaway that the city he remembered had grown somewhat (condos, condos, convention centres, giant hotels… a lot of work done for the Winter Olympics in 2010). And it looks like it’s still growing… plenty of cranes on the skyline.

"Anyway I'm thinking about it because I have had the craziest shamanic week! Good lord. Here's a true story from this week. I went to see the Sufi acupuncturist on one of his last days in the office space he has occupied for six years. On the way into the building I noticed something smelled good but I didn't give it much thought. When I walked in the office, the first thing I noticed is that everything was off the walls and out of the space except for the bare necessities - a couple of chairs in the reception area and a folding table, laptop, a phone. That was it. The Sufi acupuncturist was standing in reception when I breezed in. He turned to me and said, ""Oh! You're wearing (some Chinese word)."" I was confused. He said, ""It's the scent in Chinese medicine that cleanses energy."" I said, ""I'm not wearing any scent."" He took a step closer and sniffed me, nodded, then said, ""But you can smell it, right?"" I could! It was that good smell from the sidewalk. I said, ""I noticed it smelled nice outside."" He then went to the door to his office, leaned out into the hallway and smelled, shook his head slowly. I said, ""It smelled nice outside but not in the building."""
"When we went to the library on Thursday, Emma was drawn to the bin of board books. Seeing as she likes to listen to books that are geared towards kids who are 8 and older (we are currently listening to Inkdeath, the third in the Inkheart Trilogy), I figured she should also be able to read/listen to the books geared towards kids 3 and under. Plus, I got to sit in the super comfy extra wide glider rocker to look through my books while she searched for hers."
"Cream butter and the cup of sugar; add well-beaten eggs, then milk, vanilla, flour, salt, and baking powder. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

And then it was on to the next project. Down in one corner of the front garden was what some ‘trendy’ gardeners would call a ‘dead hedge’ or ‘wildlife area’ but what I’d call a pile of old hedge cuttings I couldn’t be bothered to clear properly the first time round. So buoyed by my newfound enthusiasm I decided to tackle it. Now while this wasn’t a ‘wildlife area’ I suspected it was an ideal site for something to be quietly going about its business so I took extra care and wasn’t disappointed when I found some slow worms.

If your soil test to the acidic side you can apply lime to the soil to raise the alkaline levels. too much alkaline is harder to treat but can be done with the application of sulfur."

I don't know if it was the traffic, the parking, the traffic, the drunks, the traffic or maybe it was the traffic, but I was always annoyed whenever game day rolled around. Thankfully for me most of the games are on Sundays and since that is family day I managed to avoid working most of the worst of it. I did work two games this year (yeah thanks NFL for scheduling a home game on Christmas Eve, my kids loved that one) but with only one more home game this year (on a Sunday!!!) I know I am in the clear."

It would have been the end of our economic system and our political system as we know it."

"Extreme Tech, Ivy Bridge: Intel’s killing blow on AMD, here. Let’s look at this again. For the FinQuant application space I’d estimate somewhere between 50% and 85% of what you care about in selecting a Linux server is the current, expected future, and realized future feature size of the fab producing the server’s microprocessors and chips. There are lots of other important variables: system and microprocessor architecture, programming languages, network transmission lines, compilers, operating systems, file systems, databases, etc. and each alone can make or break a FinQuant app, but they are all tails. The microprocessor fab feature size is the dog, it effectively determines how well my FinQuant infrastructure scales with Moore’s Law. The comparative technology priority has not always been this way. There used to be different instruction set architectures, networks were slower than DRAMs, and memories were small all requiring evaluation in addition to the shrinking microprocessor fab feature size. In all likelihood the comparative technology priorities will change in the future as well."

After many requests, George regaled the crowd with a rousing “Red Rose Café,” taking every minute opportunity to roll as many R’s as could be rolled. He played a fun rendition of “Whiskey in the Jar,” that left the pub laughing and clapping along. Not to be undone by young Keith Harkin (also of Celtic Thunder), George set to work on his own version of Seven Drunken Nights, in which he not only proved that the Derry-born whelp was naught but a R-rolling novice, but that he could do a pretty fine impression of a drunk Ryan Kelly as well.

"They were momentarily bemused by this but then decided that they needed to find the crystal and fast; some probing of the walls on the north side of the room revealed an area where a draft was coming from a gap in the stone. Elysia stood back and fired a brace of Magic Missiles at the stone, which slowly swung open to reveal a passage beyond. They started up it but they had only got half way when the creature reappeared behind them and attacked again. Elysia’s attacks caused it some damage but it seemed to be shrugging off some of the missile attacks this time and a Sunburst failed to have any impact whatsoever. She was struck by its huge bone hook and neatly grabbed, whereupon the scorpion tail reached up and over and stung her; she felt a strange weakness passing through her."

"So what about after it has calmed down? How do we address the issues? You can't really fix the underlying causes by just throwing money at it, even if we had any. Sure, you need programs to train kids, give them some skills so that they can make an honest living. We have some of those, probably not enough. But you need something else. You need to remove the alternative. What we are dealing with is a society in which for a couple of generations now the most attractive option for those growing up with fuck all is criminality. Looking around me, all my life it's seemed the easiest, most lucrative thing for those on a low income to improve their situation is to start dealing drugs. The risk of a criminal record isn't enough to stop people tearing the streets apart by now, and I reckon it's at least partly because it hasn't been enough of a deterrent so far to stop them using drugs and/or the money they can get from dealing. It's understandable enough. Wouldn't you? Any attempt to escape the incredible stress of having no money to pay off bills and spiralling debts, while living in areas populated by people who are just as fucked up, and reacting in fucked up ways. Something our dear Prime Minister is probably never going to get his head around. I doubt he has a friend who spent a year struggling with addiction, running scared and refusing to get help because the illegality brings stigma and the possibility of losing their child. I bet he's never lived somewhere he has to work twice as hard as the cunts next door who seem to be having some kind of rave-up marathon, because they're dealing while he's feeling like more and more of a schmuck for getting a job."

"Furthermore, Paul draws upon the theme of the Holy Spirit to seal his exhortation. Paul warns that to reject this command is a reject of God, more specifically the Spirit which God has given them. The Spirit was to Paul the fulfillment of Gods promise to purify and renew the people of God (Ezekiel 36:25-27; 37:14). It was an indicator of the inauguration of the messianic age and as we see from Galatians and Romans, Paul saw the Spirit as the eschatological ethos in which the people of God live and by which they war against the flesh (or the present age). Therefore, to live and please God with our vessels (v. 4) is completely in line with Gods new age that is experienced now by being in the Spirit. Therefore to reject this commandment is to war against the Spirit and to reject God."

"And lastly, you were the one to share my sadness; the one who cried with me in that cereal aisle. Camren was just six weeks old, and I was overwhelmed and exhausted. I confided in you that I didn't know how to juggle being a mother to two small children. It was busy, hard work, and I didn't think I could do it well. I felt alone. We cried, embraced beside our carts, and scared many of the (wide-eyed) shoppers who had come to the store that day! I will never forget what you told me.

"I had been interested in writing for a long time. As a pastor and teacher I spend a lot of time writing lessons that I am teaching, so writing as a discipline was something I did all the time. A few years ago I wrote a book on ministry called Visible, Vibrant, & Vital. It was work but really just an extension of what I did each week in preparing to teach. I also wrote some articles regularly related to preaching, researching, and teaching that I enjoyed. Those efforts were my first real attempt at writing for publication."
"My expectations were wondrously met as I wandered about, eyes darting back and forth at numerous booths, each simply begging for the last share of my student loan.

"I wish I had access to all the data for all the Kaiser cohorts. The one I met with this week is the 7th one that has started since my own cohort. There were about 20 people. If you put all these people and cohorts together, that’s a lot of weight-loss data! I would love to see, chart, analyze, etc. the results for this group, and for all the other people who have gone through and are going through the program at Kaiser. And then there are all the other Kaiser facilities! I hope one of the Kaiser doctors is writing or will write a research paper for a medical journal about the program and participants. I would be fascinated to know more about how all these people do, both short-term and long-term, even though I’m one of the data points myself!"

It explains my affinity for dark bitter coffee and the smell/taste of freshly baked pita bread, as well as why I rip my bread up into little pieces and dip it into my food.

And while that’s true, the experience of using a phone, a device that’s with you all day long, doesn’t boil down to what boxes get checked. The experience is driven by quality and attention to detail, how the device works and how you feel about it. There’s a reason people feel passionately enough about the iPhone to wait hours to get one on the day of a new model’s release. This happens sometimes with Android phones, but less often and at lesser scale."

"Have you ever wanted to build your own house? What would it look like? My mother always used to say there was an ideal house for every stage in your life. On your own, newly married, with little kids, with teenagers, with an empty nest, retired, needing care. But who wants to start over that many times? Your needs are met and then they change. So yes, I’ve wanted to build a house. I love the look of an A-frame chalet with towering windows, a huge stone fireplace, cathedral ceiling and an open loft."

"Whenever I wake up in the morning, the sound of the birds would barge into my ears and force me to get up. I couldn’t stand the sound of birds going “cheep cheep cheep” because they sang like they were in an opera. The sound of my grandmother cooking was equally annoying yet taunting. My room use to be right in front of the kitchen and I always saw what was being cooked because my door was glass or plastic, I can’t tell. The smoke fumed as she started frying some strange foods that I’ve never eaten before. It’s strange enough smelling something as delicious as fried food in the morning, but eating fried food of all things in the morning was terrible. I usually want to sleep more in the mornings, but the birds just get to me. Whenever they’re not around, there’s the sound of garbage trucks and school buses to force me up. Garbage trucks always arrived around 6:30 in the morning and would not stop beeping until twenty minutes later. My street must have a lot of trash. The school buses aren’t as annoying, but I always can tell they are there because of my grandma, whose voice is forever in my memory for she uses school buses to decide whether I have school or not today. I can’t believe she though I’d skip school."
"Some toe-tapping goodness was rife in “Better Than,” a hit performed on the banjo that proved to be a feel-good number despite the lyrics touching on the grass-is-always-greener syndrome. Like many of the songs performed tonight, it boasted music that had a rustic cool and homespun, country charm that was so pure and wonderful. “Good As Gone” – a loved but easily forgotten B-side – was an old, blues-fuelled track you could imagine Jack White performing."

For some, it was their beer of the festival. These reports of it's greatness turned out to be true.

"My ancestors were further from the harsh effects of the sun which others experienced near the equator, as a result we have whiter skin. People down near the equator (think Mexico, Africa, Southern Europe) were exposed to the harshest rays of the sun, and as a result over the many eons of evolution, their skin became darker to protect their skin from the sun. Now I don’t know who went which way. But, since rumor has it we all found our beginnings in Africa, I imagine that everyone started off dark and grew progressively lighter the farther away people moved away from the equator."

"Born on November 13, 1943, permit-holder John Wade has established himself as one of the leading owner/trainers in the north of England in recent years. Having left school at the age of 15, Wade started repairing and driving earth-moving machinery before becoming an agricultural engineer and stone merchant. Today he heads the highly-successful John Wade Group of companies, which has a wide portfolio of interests including waste management, recycling, quarrying, demolition and plant hire and employs 150 operatives. Wade also farms 700 acres around his Howe Hills farm in County Durham, which stages point-to-points. His involvement in racing started in the point-to-point sphere, and he initially rode as an amateur, enjoying a first success under rules on September 6, 1982, as the Arthur Stephenson-trained Glen Willy won a novices’ hurdle at Hexham. He took out a permit to train himself in 1983. Leading early performers for Wade included Clares Own, a nine-time winner over fences between 1989 and 1994, dual Cheltenham hunter chase victor Overflowing River and Stormy Lad, who was third behind Rhinestone Cowboy in the Grade Two Rossington Main Novices’ Hurdle in"

We read the first three plaques, learning something of Robin Hood’s life in the process. I’d always thought Robin Hood was just a story, but wondered about his story’s veracity when we’d passed through Sherwood Forest on our way up to York a few days earlier. Sherwood Forest actually exists! Might Robin Hood have existed, too? According to the plaques, the answer seems to be, “Yes.”"

"This quality of newness also points towards what I think is the fundamental reason I enjoy having kids. A friend and I were talking recently about the current iteration of the do-it-yourself movement. He was describing to me how enjoyable he found it to create something from scratch that he could have just gone to a store and bought off the shelf. For him, this joy comes from a combination of two factors: 1) learning how something like butter or a radio actually comes to exist, and 2) feeling an inordinate pride at having made them with his tools. Somehow, the butter tastes sweeter and the radio sounds clearer when the labor of production comes directly from his own hands."

"Fans worried about involving American money and talent in Torchwood, and the effect it would have on the production. They needn’t have, and clearly Starz knew the show they were getting involved with; if anything, Torchwood is bolder here in its outlook than ever before. It’s bloodier and more violent. It’s as bleak as ever. You want gay sex? An entire episode revolves around Jack’s relationship with a man in 1927, featuring some very graphic sex scenes, and an emotionally engaging storyline to go along with it. (It’s certainly not exploitative just for the sake of it.) The only way the show has been “Americanized” is in its look and location, as there’s no mistaking it’s now being made with American money and equipment, with the bulk of it being shot in L.A. (although much of the story is still set in Wales, and the production did spend three weeks there)."

I'm in California right now because my agent, Janet Grant at Books and Such is hosting a retreat for her authors. It's going to be a great few days of networking with some amazing authors and learning from the informative workshops she's arranged.
The fact that it’s almost Cinco de Mayo got me thinking about, well, of all things, Cinco de Mayo. In high school I lived about two hours north of the Mexican border in West Covina, California. Being a suburb of L.A., there were a number of easy access attractions available to young people including Disneyland, Knott’s Berry Farm (amazing pies and fried chicken), the famed Southern California beaches where I spent most of my summers, the San Diego Zoo and Tijuana, or T.J. as we referred to it.
He also pointed out that Nazri had yet to look into allegations that the Attorney-General’s Chambers had dropped its RM40 million corruption case against former Malacca Chief Minister Tan Sri Abdul Rahim Thamby Chik in exchange for him stepping down from all government and party positions.

That the lives of these old fellows we see on television, and whose names we now know, go back more than a century, touches us - and it may add to the power they project for us that they are not especially heroic and do not represent themselves that way. That they do not posture or make use of any of the rhetorical cliches, but are modest survivors of the ordinary circumstances and perils of living. And that on television, where glamorisation is almost a given, so that any claim they might once have had to youthful beauty is simply irrelevant. Very young people, I suspect, who find themselves living in a dangerous and chaotic world, and with their own lives fearfully before them, feel a special affection for these old fellows who have indestructibily battled through - and even a small sense of reassurance ...

"These peppers are steamed before stuffing and baking, which creates a soft, sweet pepper that simply melts in your mouth. The smooth, creamy meat and rice filling is contrasted nicely with a crunchy topping of bread crumbs and cheese. Paired with a salad draped in roasted red pepper dressing, you have a healthy and flavorful meal, a well-matched competitor for that slice of chocolate cake."

The Obama administration sued to block Arizona’s law, called SB1070, shortly after it passed two years ago, saying it interfered with federal authority over immigration. The law makes it a state crime for illegal immigrants to seek work or fail to carry proper immigration papers. It also requires police officers to check immigration status and make warrantless arrests for immigration crimes in some cases.

My mum asked whether it would ever go away.. and I said no, but the truth is that I don’t want it to. When the only other option is to fall off the edge of the world, it pushes you to give everything to strive towards something better. When everything you’ve worked for is at risk, it puts everything in perspective for a while. And that’s what drives me. I used to say to myself that I would never be back there, but the truth it that I am back there regularly, just to remind myself, and I get a kick out of that somehow. It sends adrenaline soaring throughout your body and forces you to make a decision – live or die. Perhaps I should just take up extreme sports, it might be a bit safer… I guess before, I was just scared that if I was back there, the past would repeat itself but I trust myself more than ever to do the right thing. I’m glad that I have this spring that I can bounce against every time I feel uncertain or lost.

His parents were, of course, distraught. In their pain and anger, they did something remarkable. When someone dies in the Middle East, their families often post fliers with the deceased’s photo around town to notify people. This boy’s parents did that, using a picture of him standing in a team uniform with a soccer ball. In an unprecedented and potentially dangerous move, they put of picture of his mangled body as it had been found next to it. They also included a description of what had happened and a condemnation of anyone who would do or support this kind of activity. They turned their grief into a call to action. They couldn’t bring their son back, but maybe they could do something to prevent it happening to anyone else.

I hate the weird stop – but I’ve not found a better way to do it.

“Yeah Roy. But what about Rio and JT?” “Well, I’d like to talk to all my players as soon as possible …” “Yeah Roy. What about Stevie G? What about the captaincy?” “Well, in the days ahead it will occupy my time …” “Yeah Roy, what about red card ban-shame Wayne Rooney?” “I’m looking forward very much to …” And so it went on for a while. Hodgson and the press: it is already a potent anti‑chemistry. “We’re a major footballing nation,” England’s manager mused grudgingly at one point, as close as we got to a Roy’s roar scenario. Perhaps this recalcitrance might even end up as an unlikely trump card. With the football press currently fixed in the public imagination as a sherry-stinking swarm of agenda-ridden malevolents – and going by the principle that my enemy’s enemy is my friend – if anything is likely to endear Hodgson to England’s support it is perhaps his very media-unfriendliness.

The Church has too often lagged behind other institutions in recognizing when it has erred. Howard Hendricks, longtime professor at Dallas Seminary, was fond of saying to his students, “They should charge admission to this place so that visitors can see how people used to live 50 years ago.” I pray for a day when the Church will be the engine rather than the caboose when it comes to changing society.

Long-term readers of The Realignment Project know that the through-line of my posts about economic and social policy is an argument about a long-term structural shift away from wages and labor costs and toward profits and capital that is leading to persistent weakness in labor demand, especially for jobs that pay a living wage. I believe that it is this shift and the weakness it creates that is the ultimate cause of wage stagnation.

"This trend toward greater integration of the media into the market system has been accelerated by the loosening of rules limiting media concentration, cross-ownership, and control by non-media companies.

"Personally I would not ever want to know the future. I believe we create it every day by the actions we take so how could anyone know for certain. One small choice could change everything. And that is the beauty of the future and not knowing it. If we feel we are on the wrong path we can make changes, make different choices, even small ones to change the direction we are going in. Am I saying I don’t believe in fate? I don’t know, maybe those changes we make are part of our destiny as well… stepping stones to getting where we are supposed to be. I don’t know, its one of things I could ponder for hours and never really come up with a concrete answer for myself."

"I have had some awesomely weird tables in my many lunch shifts these past two weeks. The best one being my first table Sunday. I was folding napkins when the hostess seats a middle aged man with a puffy gray David Hasslehoff mullet. He was with a very trim, very made up brunette. The doop (the paper that tells me their name, how many reservations they've made before, when they sat etc.) said they were a recommendation from a local hotel concierge. Awesome, so that means they're too lazy or think they're too busy to make an actual choice on restaurants and blindly go where someone tells them to. This bugs me, who is so important they don't have time to be adventurous, this friggin' guy. I glance at the top of the doop, the last name is french, ok no big deal. I greet them and welcome them, give them the whole deal about how our water is filtered a whole song and dance basically asking them in they want sparkling or flat water. After some debate they and by they I mean he told me what they wanted. I turned and told the new server assistant what they wanted while I went to go do something in the back. As I came out the s.a. told me I'd told him the wrong kind, they wanted flat water not sparkling. Oops, well it's just water, no big deal. OH BOY was I ever wrong. When I went over to let them know the specials, he literally puts his hand up in a stop motion while I'm talking and interrupts me. He points to the water glass in front of him and says ""You brought me sparkling, I OBVIOUSLY asked for flat. If you can't understand my accent because I'm french tell me now""...The brunette accompanying him looked pained. My mouth nearly fell open, I understand you're a dick. Prick is the same in Swahili, Vietnamese, English or French. A dick is a dick no matter what language, a dick with a stupid haircut is especially annoying. If you're this picky about your water this is going to be a VERY painful table. I smile and tell him it was a simple mistake, one that I will not repeat. I manage to tell them the specials even they they're not listening. The inspection of each others cuticles was far too engrossing. Did I mention they were sitting side by side at a four top table? Yeah, I hate that. If you're going to be that couple that insists on sitting in a 4 top booth, don't be so lovely that you need to sit next to one another and whisper,it's wierd. You're adults, not 4 year olds no one cares what you have to say it's ok to sit across from one another. You're not exactly communicating confidential nuclear secrets here. So he orders the hanger steak, but it's not that easy no, of course not. Mister frenchyhoff wants it Black and Blue. ""Do you know what that is?"" ""Yes sir I am familiar with that temperature."" WHY would you want your HANGER steak Pittsburgh? You're an idiot. ""Good, because you didn't understand me before, blue is VERY rare, cold and rare. Do you understand?"" Diiiiiiiiiiick. I nod and smile and write ""temp-D bag"" on the slip of paper in my book.Not only B&B he wants the sauce on the side, of course. His lady friend orders the salmon. It's too early on a Sunday to play your psychic friend ma'am I need to know which salmon? I ask her what temp she'd like her salmon and she just stares at me. I know this means she has no idea what this means, I think she's probably only eaten her salmon smoked or from a can. I kindly tell her salmon usually comes medium rare or even medium, and would she like that? Then I get the idea to talk her into the Salmon and eggs, to just avoid this whole fiasco, after 3 recooks the night before I didn't want to make the managers run anymore redcards. Salmon and eggs is smoked and always good I tell her. ""Oh fantastic, sauce on the side please"". Sauce on the side is health conscious I understand but it's really annoying and the cooks hate it. So after their entrees come out I do a check back. I had mentally prepared for the fussing I was sure to hear. Frenchyhoff complained that his steak was dry and asked me if they cooked it in the sauce and then cooked it off. What sauce, the Bearnaise sauce? I think not. I smile and since I was tired of listening to his lispy french bullshit I tell him that the sauce and the steak are cooked entirely separate. I didn't mention that a hanger steak is known as the butcher steak for a reason as it's not fatty and if you PITTSBURGH it, it's going to be dry. It's not a ribeye or a NY strip, there's not enough fat to make that great. Needless to say when I saw the 13% tip I wasn't really upset."

"In the novel’s opening movement, we see Puri (as he is called by the narrator) vexed by his inability to find a job and the social obstacles in the way of his marrying Kanak, the daughter of a prosperous publisher. Tara, meanwhile, feels that her world will come to an end if she is made to marry Somraj Sahni, her loutish fiance. But these problems pale into insignificance compared to the crisis that suddenly appears like a dark cloud over Lahore, as the British prepare to leave India. The Hindus of Bhola Pandhe Gali fear that Lahore might be ceded, as part of the two-nation theory that has gained currency in undivided India, to the new, primarily Muslim nation state of Pakistan."

"Joseph did not want Mary to face harsh lawful penalties which accompany the charge of adultery, nor did he want her to face public ridicule. He also realized marriage and fatherly support for this child might bring lifelong ridicule upon himself. Regardless, Joseph chose to obey Gods command, becoming a husband and an adoptive father to Christ. No matter how much Joseph may have questioned and sought understanding on his own, he eventually chose to stick with a principle to trust God’s plan. As Isaiah prophesied in Old Testament writings, the New Testament text from Matthew gives an account of Joseph’s commitment for years to come."

Also harder Quests can give more Quest points, while easy Quests only give 1 point."

"Whether it’s due to caffeine or just plain genetics, nannies are FULL of energy! When it comes down to it, we are known as “the biggest kid.” we play and run around with the little ones but also maintain our respect. We lead by example and play a significant role in how a child is raised. I must add however, that we do not replace mommy or daddy, but instead are that “extra pair of hands” that only enhance and help the parents out when needed. Parents want to come home and bond with their children and during the day time most parents are away at work which doesn’t leave much time for errand running. We create a balance for parents so that their time with their children is special and not full of mommy in the kitchen or the laundry room. I could ramble on and on about a nanny, but im pretty sure I gave a clear idea. But if you are still curious, or would just simply like to add a comment, please..DO SO!"

"Very few people today are concerned with understanding the problems associated with race, in fact the ‘broad-minded’ consensus is that we are ALL EQUAL, irrespective of skin colour. Professor Rushton’s assumptions, based on extensive scientific research, does not suggest that the overall characteristics of one specific race is superior to another race, but it does reveal that life-history evolution is still in progress, and that there are major differences between the races. Why are we then ignoring this conclusive evidence, and why are we not using the data for the benefit of all mankind?"

"In a lot of ways, Dr. Strangelove shows Kubrick really coming into what would be perceived as his ""later"" phase, in which his films are concerned with nothing so much as the alienation of the human soul, and the slow-burning anxiety of a seemingly perfectly balanced situation sent hopelessly and inevitably off-kilter. This was during the heart of the Cold War, when, despite how things turned out, many did earnestly believe that the world lay constantly on the brink of annihilation, and perhaps this was so. There's a real concern with this matter in Dr. Strangelove, underneath all that ludicrousness. As wry as the presentation is, and as bone dry the comedy is, the heart of this picture is quite serious."
"Meanwhile, I go through the motions, and hold to routine.

"Finally, as was pointed out recently by a wise friend, Christian hope must be a person before it can be an attribute. Or, true hope must be a noun before it can be a verb. Jesus Christ is our hope. It’s in and through Jesus that all God’s promises are “yes and amen” for us. Hope begins when faith apprehends Jesus and it grows as faith continues to cling to him."

"Well, I guess they were married too. I understand the problem, though. People fall in love with writers. They underline phrases on a page. They utter “yes” when some passage resonates. If the writer is similarly in love with themselves, it’s easy to succumb to this society of mutual admiration. Thank God I have a patient husband, and luckily I haven’t given him too many instances to be patient about. I have been told, more than once, by more than one man that I am the “manliest woman (they’ve) ever met.” It is meant as a compliment (coming from a man, after all) and I take it as such. What they are acknowledging is a temperament that is neither squeamish nor shrill, along with somewhat masculine appetites: good whiskey, raw oysters, rare meat, sporting dogs, leather, European cars, and bawdy jokes."

I like Bess and her family more and more, though this plot contained some pretty wild coincidences. To review for the Shelf (out June 5)."

"I'm still happily sorting through all the new pots here at the studio, took some photos of some to apply to some shows. This firing is reminding me of fall more than ever it seems, as fall is creeping closer and closer up here in these parts. The pots are more reduced and a bit darker and even flashed a brighter red this time. That could be because we put a pound less of soda in this time, as well, which was an accident, actually. We had all the soda measured out but didn't notice we forgot to put in the last pound we had planned to put in. So some of the pots were drier, but others came out with a nice balance of soda and red flash, which is usually exactly what I'm going for, I love dark red! I'm quite happy with this bowl below, had a couple of them like that, as well as the platter below."

Regardless of what Higher Power propels you through the Universe, you get those gut feelings from time to time that you are meant to barrel down a chosen path.

"Last week, I was driving through the campus where I work. I was singing along to Katy Perry's ""California Gurls"" when an approaching car unexpectedly turned in front of me going, like, .000001 mph. It came as no surprise that a blue-haired old lady was driving the car. I don't want to speculate about how old she was but I'm confident she learned to drive chariots when Ramses II was Pharaoh. I slammed on my brakes and it took every ounce of self-restraint I had to not give her a friendly, one-finger wave. However, it's hard to flip off mummified old ladies when you're been singing offkey to perky music. Upon closer observation, I realized she was attempting to turn onto a sidewalk instead of the entrance of a nearby parking lot. A long time ago, the University put up some short cement pillars at the entrance of the sidewalk so that confused drivers wouldn't turn onto it thinking it was the entrance of an interstate freeway or something. I fully expected the driver, after realizing the cement pillars were blocking her path down the sidewalk, to back up and get the hell out of my way. No. She sat there…HONKING HER HORN. Yes. Honking her horn. So I thought, ""Well, maybe she's having a heart attack or something…"". So, I got out of my car and asked if anything was wrong. She rolled down her window and exclaimed in an irritated voice, ""Well, I keep honkin' my horn but nobody's openin' the gate!"" I just stared back and blinked. I then explained that the cement barricade was not a gate and the ""road"" she was trying to turn onto was actually a sidewalk. ""A SIDEWALK?!"", she bellowed back. I then pointed out where she should turn to get into the parking lot. Meanwhile, cars were backing up in both directions because she was blocking both lanes in her huge grandma-mobile that was only slightly smaller than the Nile riverboats I'm sure she rode in as a child. She then started backing up and I walked back to my car. I got in my car and she was still backing up. I put my car in gear and adjusted the air conditioning and she was still backing up. After what seemed like 14 days, her back tires finally hit the opposite curb, she put her boat in drive, and she went on her merry way."
"Immediately, I decided I wanted to do something scientific or medical related instead, and being really into the TV show CSI at the time Forensic Science was appealing, but also Medicine as due to my families multiple medical problems I had been learning a lot about several medical conditions (cardiology and neurology mainly). Strange thing about this career choice was that I had ‘hated’ science at school, and I also had a problem of fainting at the sight of blood… Still, I enrolled on a Biology A Level course. Part way through the course I gained my first ‘real’ job which just happened to be as a Casework assistant for the Forensic Science Service (my dream job at the time…). I hadn’t been in the job 6 months before I went off ‘sick’ with stress and depression (It was actually a BPD crisis, but I was undiagnosed at this point). I left the job in the end due to pressures at home."

"There is an undercurrent flowing through certain circles in American society, a sort of backlash against what some consider to be a sense of elitism. This has lately taken the form of questioning the value of higher education. “What purpose does it serve,, some ask, “when I be just as smart without a diploma?” That debate came to my mind Sunday night as we were listening to a wonderful piece by Dimitri Shostakovich, his String Quartet No. 3 in F Major (Op. 73), written in 1946."

"I will continue to post more pictures and information on spring ephemerals and if anyone is interested, I can dedicate some posts to spring ephemerals and early flowering native perennials. I have also been growing some native perennials from seed and have just put them outside to harden them off in preparation for planting this spring. Here are some pictures of Heuchera americana and Heuchera villosa 'Autumn Bride' that I grew from seed. Not all of them will go into my gardens, some will go to friends and family so they can also have some native groundcover for their gardens. They are in 3 1/2"" pots and there are 24 to a flat and this is just a small portion of the plants, so you have some idea of how many I have to plant and distribute! Here are some more plants ready to go out, including Baptisia australis and Rudbeckia occidentalis 'Green Wizard'. This rudbeckia is a west coast native and will do well in most zones of the U.S. and the Green Wizard cultivar is a great looking plant with flowers that don't have any petals just sepals. It looks cool!"

"Miles opened the door wide and led me to a fairly large room with a bar in one end and gestured for me to have a seat by the coffee table in a cozy corner at the other end. ""I hope you didn't have lunch,"" he said in that low, raspy voice of his. Lunch? that was certainly unexpected. ""No,"" I replied, placing my recorder on the table and noticing that Miles seemed to eye it with a hint of curiosity. It was not until several days later that Teo Macero, his producer, informed me that Miles did not like to be interviewed on tape. It's a good thing that I didn't know that earlier. At the first Ida Cox session, ten years earlier, I had watched admiringly as Whitney Balliett took notes in what seemed to be shorthand and got every word and breath right. With Miles, a tape recorder was an absolute necessity, and not only did he not balk at seeing it, there were a couple of occasions when he walked over to the bar and carried my recorder with him so that I wouldn't miss a word."

All were very beautiful and her hairstyle changed with each one. Dinner consisted of about 12 dishes of food, 27 tables, with wine, beer, sprite, coke, orange juice, and white rice wine. We were the dry table… so only cola and juice for us. They passed out cigarettes, and had little boxes of candy for all of us."

"Third, the hypocrisy – Right-wing pundits (and many others) are screaming that NPR violated Williams’ rights and should be stripped of its Federal funding (the 2% of its budget it receives indirectly through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting) for stifling him. All he did was say how he really feels, right? What’s wrong with that? Where were these people when Helen Thomas lost her job for criticizing Israel? Where were they when Bill Maher or Phil Donahue got cancelled for saying what they really thought? (Glenn Greenwald has a great overview. It’s required reading for context on this issue.) The outrage in this case is hypocritical and ties back to the issue of bias. It was fine for Williams to express his fears because he targeted our current national boogeyman. Criticizing Muslims is still fine and will be defended."

"Since the whole item is intended to celebrate a significant birthday for my younger sister, I added the year in i-cord. I was ten, and had always considered myself as the little one in the family, when my sister was born. Fortunately, I have enjoyed her company from the first moment she came home from the hospital - how can that possibly be so long ago?"
"In the past I’ve written about approaching this whole gay bar thing as a feminist and how difficult it is given how the girls and I were raised as sheltered school girls. Well, Andrina realized that again after Karl and I left Saturn that night Robbie and I were reunited."
"A couple of days before, I saw the ROH's Fidelio, and it was not a pleasurable evening. This Met production is drab and dull and is thankfully being retired now - why did the opera house ever take it in the first place? I literally can't be bothered to comment on it any further, so I'll move onto the singing which was mostly fine, but never spectacular. Steven Ebel is a tenor currently in the ROH's Jette Parker Young Artists Programme, and took on the relatively large role of Jaquino. His bleating, mosquito like buzz of a vibrato is just not at all pleasant, and his cumbersomely gangly lope means he only moves badly on stage. This might seem unfair, as he's theoretically still developing as a singer and artist, but the ROHJPYA scheme is meant to be a finishing school, a last port of call before the terrifying ocean of professional operatic life. I just cannot see that he will ever be successful."
"The fact is, parents have used “sign language” for years with their babies. Babies need to express needs and parents want desperately to find out what their child wants or needs. So, often we will see gestures, whines, and partial syllables that mean something to a parent."

But it was soooo pretty and so elegant…right up my alley. So a friend on FB said to always “double-cut” intricate designs…thank you soooo much…cuz when I peeled the design off the mat it left most of the poke-out parts on the mat so I only had to poke a few out which was nice. Another tip they told me: de-stick the mat a bit, pat it with your hands a few times cuz’ its VERY sticky and that will help too.

Three other infants aged 5-9 months that were all girls, so Matthew had his pick ;-) And there were quite a few preschoolers as well. Turns out one of the ladies there is close friends with Sam's french teacher. Small world. We talked about all things parenting and it was nice. I was the oldest mother there, something I'm noticing all over the place. It feels weird but it is what it is."
"Stranger Cole and Patsy! The names are synonymous with the founding of ska and rocksteady in Jamaica in the early 1960's. Some of my earliest memories of discovering original 60's ska are of hearing Cole belt out the lilting and anthemic 'We Are Rolling' and Patsy duet with Derrick Morgan on 'Housewifes Choice' from the raw and always sensational 'Intensified: Original Ska 1962-66' album that rarely left my turntable in college. So I was beyond excited to be part of the crowd that packed the Bell House in Brooklyn in October to witness ska history. Nearly 40 years in the making (and nearly four years of persuading, pleading, and negotiating to set this show up) it finally came to pass -- Stranger Cole and Patsy reunited! Read a great review of the show over at the Duff Guide To Ska and watch footage of the show below."
"Allard recognized this and started planning the car that’s on show in 1960. He used a Chrysler Hemi V8 fitted with a GMC supercharger, clothed in a lightweight, streamlined body."
"Alex (Romain Duris) and his sister (Julie Ferrier) break up couples for a living. They have a 100 percent success rate and only two rules: Never split a healthy couple, and never fall in love. But with a week to break up beautiful Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) and her seemingly perfect boyfriend, the rules start to bend, and soon the heartbreakers risk having their own hearts broken. This charming and glamorous romantic comedy veers from laughs to tears to tears of laughter. In French with English subtitles."

"A maid bore the tidings of our arrival away into the echoing distances of the house, and while we waited we cleared our throats noisily. Then she came back, and the door was left ajar for us, and we were bidden to begin. We brought no music, the carols were in our heads. ‘Let’s give ’em “Wild Shepherds”,’ said Jack. We began in confusion, plunging into a wreckage of keys, of different words and tempo; but we gathered our strength; he who sang loudest took the rest of us with him, and the carol took shape if not sweetness."

"When you visit you can see the ruts in the road from the carts, you can walk in the bath houses and imagine that this is where at the same time you were bathing you were visiting with your friends, you can also see the brothels where there are little mosaics over the rooms to let you know what you can expect, you can meet your friends in the local wine bar and you can visit the beautiful homes of the wealthy.

"I am proud to share that yesterday I received the Emma Marie Baird Volunteer Award for my volunteer work over the years with Army Community Services and Family Readiness Groups. At a minimum you have to volunteer with ACS for five years and have over 3,750 hours! What also makes it pretty cool is that very few of this are awarded Army wide! Last year only six people received it, one being my good friend Sandy. I don't know how many received it this year but I know it wasn't that many. It's quite humbling to have been nominated at all and even more humbling to receive it. The Garrison Command also gave me one his coins which is always nice since Kevin and I have a friendly little competition going in the challenge coin department."

If there is a heaven and hell, lets just say hopefully the good that I have done in my life will outweigh all the times I have taken God’s name in vain. To keep this a family oriented blog, lets just say I have called the man upstairs several four letter names. There has been a lot of anger directed at him. Don’t judge until you are in my position."

First you cook the chicken and put it off to the side... (I wipe out the pan and start again with the oil!) I put all the veggies except the cabbage in the wok and continue to stir it until they become tender (NOT mushy) then I add the cabbage as it wilts pretty fast... I throw in the cooked chicken... and then I add some soy sauce (also depends on the amount of veggies I have!) Stir that around a bit then move the veggies to the outside edge of the wok and add some cornstarch mixed with water to the boiling liquid in the center to thicken the sauce a bit.

"A Benchmade folding knife clipped in the right front pocket. I've owned a plethora of folding knives, from every major production company: Gerber, Kershaw, Cold Steel, CRKT, etc. While all of them have performed more than adequately, I will never own a folder by any company other than Benchmade again. On the one hand, the Benchmade knives I've owned always seem slightly more finished, and more importantly, their customer service and warranty simply cannot be beat. I own a Benchmade that I've had for almost twenty years now. I carried it in a lot of ugly places, full of ugly people, doing ugly things, After about ten years, the clip fell off (never mind all the other cosmetic wear it had suffered). I tossed it in a gear box and forgot about it. A couple of years ago, while living in Oregon, I found it. I brought it into the factory store in Tualatin one day, to try and purchase a new set of clip-mounting screws. The customer service rep asked me if I could leave it with them overnight, and they could simply install the new screws. The next day, when I returned to pick up the knife, the only original part left was the blade. They had replaced the scales, liners, screws, clip; everything except the blade itself, and that had a factory edge put back on it! That's the kind of service that will guarantee my return business, as long as they still function as a corporate entity."

Closer examination of the buildings and surrounding space may reveal more keenly how the site itself reflects modern Cairo and captures a changing political landscape over generations and various regimes."

Captain Sanogo, despite the cagey game he’s played to stay in the political picture, has always publicly stated his support for regional mediation of Mali’s crisis, and now it’s unclear whether he can make his men respect any deal brokered with ECOWAS. He has repeatedly rejected any foreign troop deployment in Mali."

"It may seem strange to talk about bureaucracy in a terror organization, but without it the organization can deviate from its original ideology and become just another criminal organization. FARC, as an example, started out as a Marxist/Communist terror group in Colombia and is one of the oldest terror organizations around. In the 1980's it started picking up the Enforcer role for some of the drug cartels to ensure supply via terrorism applied to local communities, and when the cartels started to crumble FARC picked up on narco-terrorism as its main methodology. Unfortunately that is no longer even close to being in the Marxist/Communist realm and FARC graduated from ideologically based terrorism to become a narco-terrorist organization which was also capitalist in its means. FARC stopped being about anything, save for money and power. The secretive Shining Path, on the other hand, continues its smoldering and pretty useless terror campaign by remaining ideologically pure. The various Red organizations of the 1970's that dabbled in terror started out from a few, central terror organizations, but then had internal ideological disputes so that Red factions and Red groups and militant interior designers all started to show up on the terror landscape. Hezbollah remains largely an arm of the Iranian regime, but now has large external support bases so that it can work in ways that can often be at cross-purposes to Iran. The PLO factionated when it sought to become semi-legitimate and some of its virulent off-shoots went out on their own and some allied with HAMAS, the military wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood solves this, to a degree, by spinning off new terror organization (Tunisia, Algeria, HAMAS, al Qaeda) but finds that some of these don't really work to the overall benefit of the MB. They give up control and get negative feedback."

"My friend from high school also had some of the same issues I was facing at home. My husband, who is a perfect overachiever, couldn’t deal with the fact that it was recommended that Jeremy go on medication. He positively Refused to even think the possibility and so this would create lots of tension. My determine was to find a solution, whatever that was. I was dealing with the teachers and with Jeremy every day, not just in the morning or at bed time. When I took Jeremy to school, the stress stopped for my husband, but not for me or his teachers. After speaking with numerous wives, I’ve discovered that the husbands don’t believe it, or Want to believe it. It appears that because men feel that they must be strong in every situation and must cope many obstacles in life, and that having a son that is facing problems is just too much to bear. Most of the dads of the boys with Sid are in denial at first. The wives tend to have to deal with finding out what the issues are all by themselves by researching, talking and finding solutions. Many of the husbands fight the wives to the end until the wife ultimately convinces her mate to “just speak with an expert”. In one case I know, the father uses the excuse, “he’s just like I was” so he assumes it is okay. Meanwhile, everyone along with his wife is going crazy having to deal with his child. My friend is of the mindset that if there Is help available, then she’s going to get it! In reality, many of these men are right, because the kid Is just like them… And if there would have been help for their own mothers way back when, then the moms more than likely would have taken it instead of suffering straight through it and of procedure it would have made everything easier on the child. They could have learned tactics that would have helped them carry on their actions, their bodies and their behavior."

"Herbert paid his debt to society by twiddling away the days in solitary confinement. Herbert’s personally prohibited him from becoming familiar with the inmates he was stranded with. Being friends with anyone wasn’t an option. It became a well-know fact that he couldn’t get along with others, especially in confined places. Whenever he was in the general population, he pursued fights on a daily basis. Arguments were his passion and ”asshole” soon became his middle name. Not even the meanest of the mean would mess with Herbert. The years put a definition of anger in the creases of his drawn face. The look of a psychopath was naturally etched into his smile. Inmates made it a point to stay away from Herbert whenever he wasn’t being kept in solitude. However, when he was alone, away from all other prisoners, Herbert was the perfect inmate. The guards had no problems with him. They came to the understanding that Herbert caused fight in order to stay out of general population. “Clooney, why are you here? Can’t you behave? You shouldn’t be here.” One guard said to Herbert. “I wouldn’t mind havin’ you taste a little of my famous brew. It’s smooth as southern silk.” Herbert said to the officer. It wasn’t easy time for Herbert. However, it did keep him out of trouble."
