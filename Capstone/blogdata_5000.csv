"Sugar’s sweet, so is she,"
"So because the Asian community was so by need tight-knit, the next thing you know I have Asian kids following me around, you know doing more shit for me than the boys that wanted inside of me. Especially the two in particular. They thought I was “so wonderful” which sickened me even further. I was not wonderful, it reminds me of that quote, from WWII era forget it but goes on to say something like, “It was not that I was a hero, it was everyone around me was acting so badly” when someone won a humanitarian award."
Nicholas’ brain runs on and is excellent at processing data and concrete facts. He works best with things he can quantify. He runs into an almost insurmountable challenge in trying to rationalize the existence of his exceptional infant daughter and what she represents. He isn’t without a sense of humor and is very loving but he is forced to radically confront his limitations.

"His own family had to witness exclusion and had to be apprehensive to be pusuited. So his grandfather decided to escape from germany in 1934, heading to Britain. This must never happen again, Andy says, and he tells about his worries about right-wing partys in Europe, which seem to get more popular again."

"My sweet boy, who I dote on, is quite capable of doing this (resisting training) for months. He has in the past and patience and consistency are called for and will win the day in the end. He might decide to get with the program this week, or it might be months. Time will tell, but I think I know now that this is a likely response from him when training goes to a new level."
"And so on, and so on..."
"For some reason I didn’t initially investigate any further into her catalogue, but then one Friday at work I was talking to another friend who loved Ann Peebles. The next day, on my way into town to the shops, I decided I simply had to buy a Peebles record. My first stop was Reckless in Berwick St, which still had a basement where a box of soul singles sat on the counter. Having inherited not only my dad’s hoarding tendencies, but his acute sense of relative value, I’ve never bought many 7″s (or “45s” as we must trendily refer to them now) and 9/10 times I deliberately avoid looking beyond the LP and 12″ sections in any shop. I was on a mission this time though and miraculously, as I began to flick, there it was, second record in the box, as if I’d just willed it there. I excitedly parted with my £3 and while I have no memory of what if anything else I bought that day, I remember it was definitely raining. Getting the record home, I had a bonus discovery with the equally brilliant b-side, part of whose intro is the backbone to a GZA track I was a bit obsessed with at the time (a huge proportion of early RZA production relies on the Hi back catalogue). In contrast to the a-side, the song is much more positive than its title indicates: she’s bidding goodbye to her troubles and sadness, or rather, as is more customary for Peebles, telling them to piss off."
"Forest City Ratner Companies and its Brooklyn Events Center subsidiary would have a tiny fraction of the jobs. Some 1000 part-timers would be hired by AEG, in charge of arena operations, and 900 hired by Levy Restaurants, in charge of food service."
"Then, the most exciting news of all, on August 19th our sweet baby Jane joined our family! She was born at 1:59 am after 7 hours of labor (which was so much better than Annabelle's 16 hours of labor) and was 7lb 6oz 20 in long. Jane looks a lot like Annabelle when she was a baby but they definitely have their own personalities. We are so happy this sweet baby girl could join our family and Annabelle loves her new little sister! Jane is such a little live wire. Right when Jane was born she could lift her head and was always moving. She isn't my cuddly baby like Annabelle was but still a sweet, happy little one. She moves so much she learned to roll over at 3 1/2 months! Now at 5 months she is army crawling everywhere!!! Crazy huh! She is just a little determined one and is probably going to walk soon I swear!!! Jane just had her 4 month Dr appointment and she weighed 12 lb 2 oz which makes her only in the 10th percentile . She is just a little one and it's probably because she moves all the time. Annabelle is such a good big sister and loves to make her laugh. If she is sad she gives her toys and tries everything to make her happy. But there are those moments when I hear Jane cry and I see Annabelle trying to ride on her back like she does with daddy, but I guess that is just what big sisters do. :) It gets kind of crazy being a mom of two now but I love it and it is always an adventure!"

"The firm of TrimTabs itself is taking a cautious stance and reducing its market exposure to zero from 50% exposure. TrimTabs’ reasoning is that the end of QE2 to spell the end of the ‘propping up of the market’. While certainly understandable, this is information that is all too well known and already priced into the market. They go on to write to their clients that the “S&P 500 is down 6.8% from its interim closing high on April 29, and we expect market action to get even uglier this summer.” Their terrible track record makes it tempting to fade them here."

"Wrists (bind): On a successful attack by a whipwhirl to bind an opponent’s wrist, there is a possibility the victim will “fumble” and drop anything it might be holding in its hands. The base chance of a fumble from a whipwhirl wrist attack is 100%, minus 5% per point of dexterity of the affected target (e.g., a character with a dexterity of 18 would have a 10% chance of fumbling on this type of attack.)"

"Here is a video where I talk about the tips and give you a tour of the system. I tried to write as clearly as I could in this post, but sometimes it’s better to just see it in action because it is tough to explain:"

"There are lots of guidelines - which lots of people treat as immutable laws - like 'show don't tell' and 'don't use 'was'' and so on. There are lots of distractions, like 'use 12 pt Times Roman' (I have never submitted a MS in 12pt Times Roman, and I have never had one rejected because it was in the wrong font). If I tell Adrian how I write, he might think that's my prescription for successful writing. It's not. It's possibly a very bad way to write - for other people. But it works for me. He will have his own way of writing that works for him. So much for the activity of writing - I'm not going to say 'you have to have a detailed plan' or 'never write a detailed plan'. But what I want to get Adrian to do, when I talk to him about his novel, is to understand what he is writing and how it works or could work. So I ask him questions like 'who is the narrator?' It is an omniscient narrator. 'Does this narrator have a character? Is he/she reliable? How do you switch between points of view? What are your main character's flaws? Which of his opinions do you share and which not? How does he change during the course of the book? Why?' And so on."

"I’m sure some of you have wondered how I got into western writing. I grew up watching Gunsmoke, Paladin, Bonanza, etc. My dad loved westerns. Top this with the fact I enjoy reading about history.

"Now any self respecting physicist, but more especially a graduate of Patrick Moore's 'Observer's Book of Astronomy', c.1969 (alpha-this, gamma-that is conspicuous in the winter sky, etc), should be able to read alphabetical greek... ""Argonautica... is that the Tim Severin expedition?"" - the one I'd read about in my father's Telegraph supplement? I'd just sailed back from Trebizond on the regular ferry after back-packing around Turkey. They'd just rowed a thousand miles in the opposite direction from Volos (Iolcos) to Georgia; their tremendous callouses bore witness to that fact, and to pretty useless winds. But they'd reached Jason's destination and found that people still ""pan for gold"" using sheep fleeces there, in the mountain streams."

"Grandma parked down the street from Bobby's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk. Then Grandma gave me a nudge. ""All right, Santa Claus,"" she whispered, ""get going."" I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell and flew back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma. Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open. Finally it did, and there stood Bobby."

"5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.

"It is ironically appropriate that the end of the bill’s main content is the definition of “self-protected entity”, a definition that when defined includes ANY entity other than an individual. It is important to encourage persons and citizens of democratic nations to read their laws and the legislation that affects them. Undoubtedly for some, this may be the first text of legislation they have ever read their entire lives, and it is important that they begin reading such texts. Do not let government spokesmen, or political and social commentators, though the screen or through text, tell you what is going to affect you, and how its going to affect you: You have a responsibility as a citizen to know what is going to affect you and your life, and of the lives that shall come after you. Internet Censorship."

I made an easel giftcard for a change. The card itself is made around a box of toffifee which cost me £1 from poundland. I removed the outer sleeve which leaves the chocolates still in their protective covering and used the sleeve as a template to make an outer wrapper for the box. I then made an easel card the same size as box which I attached to the box when it was decorated. It was quite easy to make and makes a nice (cheap) thank you gift! The papers and design are quite plain but I wanted the main focus to be on the image. If it wasn't a sample for TV and I was giving it away myself then I would probably make a matching box but I didn't bother.
"The second song litters the ear with a blistering insistent shower of metallic artillery of riffs, picking and spotting the senses like hailstones until a lull leads into a feisty and formidable display of towering riffs and sharp melodic manipulations.

"We grew up. We moved away. She's a social worker in Madison, now, and I'm an office manager and church organist in Milwaukee. We run into one another once in awhile at funerals. We both made it to adulthood, safe now from eagles, gypsies, and the threat of the Ickle Ockle bushes. I think of that on warm summer nights when the fireflies are out."
"Winter, the kind with snow, finally began here on Friday. It was short-lived though. I shoveled steps, decks, ramps, and pathways blanketed by six inches of heavy white stuff until my arm muscles turned wobbly. My mittens were stuck frozen to the shovel, and despite the frigid temps, my head under hat was laden with sweat. I felt like I had just finished an exhaustive hour-long gym workout. But like I said, the gorgeous winter snow was short-lived. Rain soon swept in and reduced the mass to about an inch or so of undulating ice. I have yet to try the car on the long downhill rink we call the driveway. A walk to the mailbox yesterday revealed coyote tracks, emerging from the woods into our drive and across the road. Bello, my feline walking companion, curiously sniffed the tracks, looking about with caution. I suspect that the coyote had walked as we did only a short time previous."

Written by Adam Gauntlett, whose previous contributions to titles published by Miskatonic River Press, Pagan Publishing, and Pelgrane Press, have all been well received, The Millionaire’s Special is a mini-adventure set on the RMS Titanic, in which several First Class passengers – or is that player characters – must face a threat already aboard the luxurious liner, whilst their players know that they will face certain death by adventure’s end."

No more putting off figuring out the rules for magic. The wizard has been backed into a corner and has to start explaining things to the trogg girl.

"Bad copy editing, on the other hand, introduces new errors while overlooking existing errors. Bad copy editing cites Wikipedia as a definitive source. Bad copy editing betrays cluelessness about the author's tone and style while revealing far too much about the copy editor's own limitations (and, perhaps, failed ambitions). Bad copy editing is painful. It takes time and is horribly enervating. Bad copy editing causes one to wear out pencils writing STET over and over. Stet is Latin for ""let it stand,"" which is to say, it is a veto of a correction. But if you have to write it too many times on a manuscript you begin to think it is actually the Latin for ""fuck off."""

"The much anticipated Sex and the City 2 movie has finally opened with lots of promotion and press as one might expect. I haven't seen it yet (have you?), but I've naturally been very interested in the look and feel of the movie. Based on the movie trailers and still photography that's floating around - we can definitely say that this movie is filled with color and texture. The TV series and first movie were more about the clothes, but this one seems much more about the (dare I say it?) surroundings. As Carrie says in the movie ""I've been cheating on fashion with furniture"". Music to our ears! Lots of other blogs and sites have been covering the interior design of this new movie, including lots of resources, so I'll post a link to those sites at the bottom. However, I thought it would be interesting to compare the evolution of the interior design from television series through the two movies. Since much of the creative team is the same, it makes for an interesting exercise, I think."

And ostensibly they abandon the sock and scramble after the treats and eventually they will abandon the sock on the command, no treats necessary."

And the past should stay the past, right, because people who tried to escape the labyrinth were seldom heard from again by those good and proper souls who kept their heads down and didn’t listen to the dreams that whispered to them in their waking hours. And you try not to think of all those wasted years in the darkness, because that only leads to Regret. And if Laziness is Fear’s bratty kid brother, then Regret is his sad-eyed spinster aunt."
"He likes to ""sweep"" with his little vacuum at any given time, but especially if he sees someone else using the real vacuum. Then he runs and gets his and follows them around. Cute. But this cute little habit has quickly become a weird obsession. He LOVES the real vacuum. If he sees it he goes crazy trying to pull the plug down and start pushing it. I have had to relocate it from its previous spot tucked between a shelf and a wall in the dining room to the mudroom. Oh and he loves brooms. The kid has a serious thing for brooms. He's constantly maneuvering himself around the gate to get into the mudroom to get one of the brooms and then he walks around sweeping. He does a pretty good job, to be honest! Or he tries to get the vacuum. It's a constant struggle with him. I'm pretty sure he wants to be a janitor when he grows up. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm just surprised that he's found his life's calling at 15 months old."
"Having qualified fifth, Alesi snatched third from his team-mate Gerhard Berger when the Williams of David Coulthard spun off on lap three. He eased past Damon Hill and on his 31st birthday, looked set for an excellent second place finish. For once, lady luck was shining on Alesi and dominant race leader, Michael Schumacher suffered a gear selection glitch that lost him a full minute. Driving the famous No.27 in Montreal, the number Canadian hero Gilles Villeneuve had in his Ferrari days, Alesi took the chequered flag at his 91st attempt. His Ferrari ran out of fuel on the slowing down lap to complete his lucky day. However after all the bad luck in his career, no-one could deny Jean his deserving moment on the top step of the podium."

"Kim Hyun-sung (Jang Hyun-sung), a hard-boiled fund manager, spends an evening of heavy drinking with his co-workers at a restaurant. A colleague shows up with some airsoft rifles, and soon all of them are pointing their weapons every which way and firing them in the busy restaurant. The server asks the guests to put the firearms away, and Hyun-sung ends up getting into a brawl with the waiter. The next day, following a probe into the company’s financial dealings and the suicide of one of his associates, Kim flees to the wooded retreat of one of his friends, hoping to recover his equilibrium. Instead, his buddy convinces him to take part in a war game with some friends. This vigorous if not wholly original exploration of the ruthlessness of business culture firmly embraces the dogme esthetic, the camera crew and boom mike being plainly visible in one restaurant scene.

I had one who spoke so softly I had to sit in front and still strain to hear. I had one who invited us all to his farm for the winter and summer solstice. He sat on his desk, swinging his feet, clad in dirty shit-stomping boots, smoking a pipe. I think he was high a lot. And I had one who scared the hell out of me. I don’t know why. But, he was a great English teacher and he loved poetry."

"Which leaves only it’s status as part one of an accidental trilogy (since Castrovalva wasn’t even remotely planned when this story and Logopolis wrapped). I suppose I’ve rather given the game away on that one by pointing out that it’s an accidental trilogy, but there it is - this is in no way intended to be the start of some high concept arc, and reading it through that lens is deeply misguided. Again, there’s some distant interesting aspect here - the way in which Bidmead and Nathan-Turner navigate the nearly impossible task of writing Tom Baker out of Doctor Who is an impressive piece of television show-running. They take the counter-intuitive but likely necessary approach of declining to make Baker’s departure the climactic event or allowing him to be the star of it, instead opting to build the Davison era’s trappings up around Baker and then finally delete him from a show that’s no longer his own. Certainly several major steps in that direction happen here."

"The massive, well-organized deployment of enormous sums of money by the business and (especially) the financial elites have in large measure made American politicians, regardless of party, into the tools of the wealthy elites: Bush cut taxes on the very rich to near-historic lows, and the right-wing Roberts court more or less legalized political bribery in the Citizens United decision, but it was Bill Clinton who began the deregulation of Wall Street that led first to massive profits for the few, then to an terrible crisis for the many, and it was Democrat Chuck Schumer who kept capital gains taxes so low that most hedge fund managers pay taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries. The Koch brothers and those of their ilk don't consider themselves stewards of national well-being, not really: they consider themselves people who have a right to buy the means to rig the system ever-further in their favor. For them, this is simply their prerogative. Acting on this presumed prerogative has made them very wealthy, but it has also made their whole class less and less legitimate in the eyes of the public, despite the constant drumbeat of political advertisements and the far-from-disinterested vision of events presented on Fox News and other corporate media platforms."
"My review of the first reading of Still Life can be found here (Feb 2009). I remember liking the book and being impressed with Penny's style of writing and I enjoyed the characters, hoping we would meet them again in future books. And we did get to chum with them in the sequels. Penny unwraps parts of each character and lets us slowly get acquainted with them as we might a new friend. In this reread I was reminded of earlier descriptions of the characters and to see them in light of what I knew about them from later writings. My word, they are such multi-faceted, complex, flawed, and yet lovable people. The following quote illustrates how well Penny brings her characters to life, as well as her understanding of human nature and her gift for expressing it in writing."

Also, no less important we want to give their parents a rest, some quiet and a little bit less to worry about.

Even at the age of 50, she’s far too tough on herself. V.I. does some considerable soul searching while assuming the persona of a champion whose mission it is to right injustice."

They are told that their donations are vital to “defend” or “protect” the Church, that they are key to “expanding” the Church (buying more real estate). So they give more and more money."
"The Theme is Spring cards and Violets always remind me of spring. Since I'm an amateur photographer, I also took a bunch of pictures of my spring violets, so I decided to use them as the focus in my card. I have a small collection of copic markers and have been practicing blending colors, so I though I'd try using my pictures I took."

Conducted with independent assurance from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the model measures the number of people globally who, on an average day, read FT journalism in print and online.

It lamely asserted that RAINBOW RESPOSABLE creates an incongruity because ""a reusable and disposable rainbow does not exist.""

"The rest of the night all I tried to do was think of other things to keep my mind off of what was going on. I said a prayer and actually felt pretty good after it was over and I took that as a good sign. Heavenly Father knows what is best for me. When I woke up all I wanted to do was get into the doctor and see my baby and to know what was going on. Lincoln came with me this time and we were both so nervous, I couldn't stop shacking. The Doctor walked into the room and said that he was thinking about me and worrying about the baby and said he was hoping that he was just over reacting yesterday. I started crying before the ultrasound even started. The moment she was on the screen you could see her little heart beating and right at that moment you could tell she was okay. Her heart was beating perfectly. She was up to 165 bpm again. Which is normal. I started crying such a wave a relief rushed all over me. I love listening to her heart it sounded so much better then yesterday. The doctor checked her again and again to make sure she looked great and she did. I am going back in 2 weeks to make sure she stays the same."

I may be a junkie for unliterary crack. I don't pretend to know what constitutes ""social substance"" or ""artistic importance"" in a short story--and I'm not sure that I'd want to read anything by a writer who was so self-important that they'd try to tell me something socially substantive or artistically important anyway!”"

"Posters and fences enclose the wasteland, although not much effort has been expended in keeping them up, revealing an absolutely huge, poisoned-looking grass expanse, broken up by two buildings and a public sculpture. The wager was that 'Boro might become a tourist destination, if Alsop and invited architects like FAT were to be given their head; the renders in front of the wastes show a Super Mario World which bitterly contrasts with what is in front of your nose. The public sector levelled the area for, so far, an optimistic temporary suite designed as an aptly upturned lime green box, and the new Middlesbrough College by Hickton Madely at Archial. This is a huge building, and aside from the Bridge it dominates Middlehaven, its curving mass covered in a silver and yellow cladding, with small windows punched into it at random. Round the back, it's a huge white shed, as if we wouldn't be looking. Far away is the other building – the Docks' Clock Tower, attributed to Philip Webb – tall, gaunt and profoundly haunting in this dreamlike, spacious and sinister context. Between the dereliction is red and black landscaping, carrying at least some of the renders' cartoonish promise, connecting the area to the football stadium, or to another publicly funded project – Anish Kapoor's Temenos."

"It is clear to me that in today’s context, the lever to move the world, or should I say equity markets, is free money. Sure, central banks don’t have a choice when the new orthodoxy is for governments to pursue austerity with great fury but it’s also expressly meant to lever the stock markets of the globe out of their doldrums."

"We are not even quite sure what the allure of Jack Falstaff is. We'll call it the 'James Ormsby Je ne sais quoi factor'. The attraction is certainly not the look of the space, hidden behind a sleek, industrial doorway. The interior is modern but ordinary, dressed in velvetines and sagemint greens that could have jumped straight from the pages of a West Elm catalogue. The ambience fares well from the low, highly-polished dark wooden ceiling that subdues the sound allowing a dinner conversation to flow with ease, thereby helping to keep the dining experience a relaxing affair."

Later, Absalom rebelled against his father… and he won the heart of many of the men of Israel as he formed a conspiracy to take the throne. A battle ensued… Absalom died, hung by his own hair."

My first mini album took me 9 months to complete... yes, I said MINI album... and I was so scared to tackle each page that I hesitated, scrapped, hesitated some more...

If you are new to scrapping or break out in hives when it comes to mini albums, here is one of my favorite design tips... Go simple and use ONE line of paper. Don't worry about matching this embellishment to this tag to that paper... choose a line of product that was designed together... it will all match beautifully and make your job MUCH easier!"

I realized that even if this was nothing, something, someday, something tragic and life changing is coming. Whether its to me or a loved one, its coming. And I need that reality to change my life.

"Stepping outside after dark was the biggest treat of all; a veritable cornucopia of astrological delight enveloped me and captured my immediate and unwavering attention. Had it not been for the incessant attack of viscous sandflies I could have stayed there all night, every night, gazing up in awestruck wonder. As it was, it became a nightly ritual, after putting the littlest hobo to bed we would head out into the inky darkness and stand in front of the house looking up for a few minutes, the void of silence echoing on the mountains that surrounded us.

"Well, this was one BIG issue with me since I couldn’t stand Baby #1 wrestling with the Lact-Aid. But this time around I learned a tip. Get one of those lactation bras where there is a triangle (my hubby calls them the butt-chaps bras because they look like those cowboy chaps with the whole for the bum). Stick the Lact-Aid in that space right at the middle and then run the tubing under the fabric that goes on top of your breast. This reduces the odds of it shifting around AND keeps you from having to use tape. Yes, the wrestling will still happen, but this helps."
"One may ask, How can something be inside and outside at the same time? Parīkṣit therefore names a prominent Vedic deity: Vāyu, god of the sky.

Similarly All-Attractive Hari is the soul within everyone and everything, yet is an individual person as well, greater than and distinct from everyone else."

"A president’s likeability is much overrated. Hoover may have been unliked, but the same can’t be said about incumbent losers Ford, Carter, and George H. Bush. Those presidents lost their re-elections because voters perceived them as unsuccessful in their jobs. Most voters would have gladly sat down over beers with any of those three men."
"Much more prominent in the novels than in the series. Novel Dark Passenger (DP) is portrayed as a separate, conscious entity that lives inside Dexter and drives much of Dexter’s Need to kill. It’s described as being able to enter a person who has experienced a severely traumatic event, especially as a young child. While some feel this “possession” element of the novels spoils the storyline, I think it adds an interesting supernatural element and allows for more storytelling freedom."
Days like yesterday make it all worth it.

"I am so grateful for the way that my faith shapes my life and my values and for the way that it strengthens me and leads me to good things. I am grateful that because of faith, I am able to be brave in the face of hard things, to feel joy in the midst of trials, and to have hope in the future. Could I be a mother without faith? Sure. But faith makes me a much better mother than I could ever be on my own."
"I notice no one's criticising Jennifer's extremely well muscled, well nourished looking male co-stars. It's fine for them to look as if they've been eating enough to keep alive. Apparently it's only female actors who have to bow to 'realism' to such an extent that they should look gaunt, bony and as if trying to draw a bow would snap them in half."
"Taylor took to the screen early in life, however, long before her shapely figure caught up with her beautiful face. I recall watching the National Velvet movies as a kid, but haven’t indulged in them lately. It is not often that child stars can actually last past their cute youth and make it in the grown up world of film. I almost separate Taylor into two actresses because the adorable, sweet roles of her childhood contrast so differently from the later work."
"A must-have book for all vampire fans, A Brief History of Vampires charts the phenomenal craze of ‘popular vampires’ such as Nosferatu and Count Dracula to screen vampires such as those played by Bela Lugosi and Robert Pattinson. With the current global vampire craze taking the book, film and TV charts by storms with the Twilight saga and True Blood, this book begs the question: why do we love to be frightened?"

"A bacteria to me looks like a blob that can move. That’s pretty cool when I think about it. A blob of mayonnaise can’t move (and I’m happy about that). But under the microscope, blobs move. Hopefully not the mayonnaise blob. But bacteria blobs move."
"“Well then,” I say cheerily, trying to lighten the mood. “Let’s go find some breakfast.” We split up and I pick some berries from the scraggly bushes growing in the rocks. Henry manages to find some mushrooms and two walnuts. Gypsy and Todd wait patiently while we dangle our feet over the edge and gobble down our meager breakfast. The fog is lifting and we can see for a few miles as the bottom of the ravine slowly climbs back up to meet the sky. My stomach still grumbles but I hand my walnut to Henry."

I have read blogs for years, I love reading blogs and have always wondered what I could have a blog about. Would anybody read it. What would I write about. Well there has been plenty for me to write about really but it's finding the time to sit down and actually write. So today, here I sit, looking at my very disorganised house, clutter everywhere and I have to do something about it! So I thought, I will blog about my disorganised life and hopefully it will become organised once again.
In a face-to-face interaction we can support our verbal message with our body language, for example, the former President Bill Clinton was known as a very capable public speaker. Much of what he said in his speeches was communicated with hand gestures. Gestures are a very powerful way to amplify one’s intentions in public speaking. They also serve as a channel to bring the audience into the speech (which Clinton excelled in). This is also one of the reasons why Clinton’s supporters or even non supporters believed what he said at the time. His gestures aided his overall credibility.
Ryan “So Hot the Water” Broyles tore his ACL in November 2011 the same way the compact receiver tore through BIG12 defenses, becoming the NCAA receptions leader with 349 catches. He will probably be selected in the 3rd round, although he could fall further. While his height is limited and his speed is unknown until he fully recovers, the kid a extremely talented and a solid route runner. He could end up being the steal of the the draft if he falls down further than the third round. If fully recovered, he should be able to contribute early. Just five months removed from his ACL surgery, Broyles recorded a 32.5-inch vertical jump and 4.57 time in the 40-yard dash at his Pro Day. There is no doubt that he should be faster by the start of the 2012 NFL season.

"Since watching a number of episodes of The Electric Company (yeah, Netflix!) she completely understands the concept of the silent E and while she doesn't know yet which words have a silent E and which don't, if she is struggling to say a word and I tell her ""silent E,"" she can immediately say it; she knows exactly what each vowel should sound like in that situation. I think it's really cool how easily she learned that and how well she knows the vowels' different sounds. The Electric company has also taught Sweet Pea how to read words with 's or 've or 'd, etc. at the end. She doesn't yet fully understand possessive uses of apostrophes, but she totally gets that ""doesn't"" is a contraction of the words ""does not."" It is incredible how easily she picks up some of this language stuff!"

"For there was something fundamentally very evil going on in that school, though my brothers and I were fortunately, miraculously untouched by it. During the years I was there, five of the ten teachers (three brothers and two laymen) were sexually abusing many of the boys entrusted to their care. One of them was the tall young brother teaching the class parallel to ours, a class in which I was often a guest on the (not infrequent) occasions when Mr. Mooney called in sick. His ready use of the cane ensured that he had no discipline problems. He also had the custom of having boys sit on his lap for long periods of time – fortunately, he had his particular pets and we guests were not selected for this “special” treatment."

We, the unseen masses of men, women, and children with broken pee machines, are usually crippled by a bladder flare."

"Oppression is what the non-dominant groups of a category experience, which is essentially not having the same treatment and access to resources/privileges as the dominant group. For example: Aboriginals receive a significant amount less from welfare than non-Aboriginals. Internalized oppression is when an oppressed person begins to believe the stereotypes and awful statements about their group; for example, a Black woman begins to believe that she is not as deserving of fair treatment as White people are, or a gay man believes he is a sinner and is flawed for ‘choosing’ to be gay. Lateral violence is when, as a result of this, an oppressed person retreats to his or her group, or perhaps lashes out at the dominant group or at the very least, refuses to interact beyond his own culture; we see this when people react poorly to interracial dating, for example."

"Knowing it is indefensible, the various self-investigatory reports will try to hang their underlings out to dry and tell us Mark Kennedy was a rogue officer straying off-mission. When all seven exposed officers behaved more or less identically, the police need to tell us how many it takes to prove that far from following orders, this was strategy. And more than that, who devised, approved and ordered this political policing?"

"The other day I was looking at the line up for The Great Escape and I couldn’t help but be amused and pleased by a lot of the band names. Forgive me for not being more ‘down with the music-o people’, but I hadn’t heard of a lot of them, so these band names were completely new to me. I wanted to share some of my favourites on Twitter, but the list was getting longer and longer, so I thought I’d bore anyone that’s going to accidentally stumble across my blog with it."

That’s because the difficulty level is dynamic, based on the players competing."

"Some accounts state that wedding rings did not become common until the 11th century. Others believe the ancient Romans were the first to offer wedding bands, but they were a symbol of ownership used to claim women. Historic accounts give a little more romance to the Romans. Roman betrothal rings were once made of iron and called ""Anulus Pronubus."" They symbolized strength and permanence. It is also thought that the Romans were the first to engrave their rings."

"Finally, there is a new butcher, imaginatively titled ""The Butcher Shop"". It's near Woolworths, in the square in the corner. From Woollies, go past the chemist and jeweler, and look to the right, across from the Shiny Things Shop. (Not its real name.) They're in the new tradition of butchers, with house-made sausages and ready made kebabs and marinated ready-to-go roasts. They stock King Island beef. I haven't checked all the details about what's local and what's free range yet, but I can say that the sausages, silverside and lamb chops that I've had so far have all been top quality."
"Well, after putting up with his insults (like ""nice bangs"" in reference to my current Yul Brynner 'do) I actually piledrive the kiddo a few times which doesn't do much for him, given his spine seemed to be made of a slinky.

The rapier-like witticisms kept on a'comin' (I remember him shouting ""Keep your cholesterol-laden hands off me!"" as I tried yet another debilitating wrestling move) though soon the social intercourse (no, not that!) was broken up by none other than mother, who chastized me for treating company in such a way even if that company was an annoying rock critic bigmouth who was more'n responsible for helping destroy the Generation of Bangs and Meltzer and turning it into one big Voice of Whoredom!"

Ingram ~ With You ~ Other End ~ 1984
"While he had a strong enough grip to get the job done in college, I’d like to see Andrew continue to improve his functional strength at the next level. He shows good hand placement with proper technique in his ability to fire his hands inside on the defender and uses his flexibility and wide frame to make it difficult for rushers to get around him on the edge. I’d like to see Datko get stronger in the lower half in order to improve as an anchor in pass protection, as he isn’t yet strong enough to take on and consistently neutralize some of the bigger, stronger ends he’ll face at the next level. He’s not a full-fledged drive blocker in the run game, and while he’s shown enough of an ability to execute down blocks in college, I’d like to see him continue to develop better lower body strength to improve here. In the run game, he uses his quick feet off the ball to his advantage with his ability to engage the defensive lineman off the ball before attempting to properly position the defender away from the hole to wall him off an open up a clear running lane. Having played in Florida State’s zone-blocking offense, he could be an intriguing fit for the Packers blocking scheme."

"Sometimes after a long day of wandering and singing and climbing trees and playing, we would lie down in a cool green thicket under a lacy curtain of wisteria, and Rabbit would fold his arms around me prayerfully. I would rest my head in his warm hair and he would say, “I love you too much to ever use you.” He was one of the dearest men I have ever known, and I regret losing track of him when he moved away to the west coast."
"Even though the Powhatans returned the prisoners and some of the equipment they had captured, the colonists were not satisfied and a year-long negotiation began. In that time Pocahontas remained captive in the town of Henricus where she fell under the influence of Reverend Alexander Whitaker, who persuaded her to embrace Christianity. While there she also succumbed to the romantic advances of John Rolfe, a pious tobacco planter who had recently lost his wife. After being baptised under the new name of Rebecca she married Rolfe on 5th April 1614. In January the following year, the couple had their only child, Thomas Rolfe. While the marriage did not secure the return of all the colonists' possessions, it did cement amicable relations between them and the Powhatans."
"Our attending this show was an idea that came about because we need to reach a new audience.

You know, I think (much like Oprah – another childless mommy advisor) that the hardest thing you can do is raise a kid. And even harder is raising a kid right and saving the world from the addition of one more a**hole. This is of such monumental importance in my opinion, that it does, indeed, take a village. So, I’m here to help. As I was working up some research this morning, I came across some parenting ideas / actions/ products that I feel could lead your child astray. I am here to try and stop you…or rather stop the ridiculous human being who would subject their child to any of the below."

"It was once that individuals that have been going offshore on cross country cruises selected boats that had been extremely heavily built and were generally not to fast, often unresponsive using conditions. Tactics on these boats were somewhat distinct from the engineered boats these days. These older era boats could well be forced to heave to or lay a hull in two extremes. The crew would close everything up and go below and wait out. Sometimes this was successful, sometimes it wasn’t."

"But as with any adaptive strategy, it eventually becomes maladaptive. If an organism cannot evolve to match changing conditions--in this case, rapid fossil fuel depletion, climate change, soil degradation and so on--then dieoff or extinction can follow. And, just because I and many others can articulate the problem, it does not at all imply that a meaningful and broad-based understanding can spread and that a response can be implemented in time to avert the worst. Every fiber of a human being instinctively rejects limits on energy gathering--unless those limits can be framed as a necessary sacrifice for the good of a group to which that human being feels a strong attachment."

In the midst of feeling excited that it’s nearly time for my favorite Farmer’s Market to open, and in the midst of being happy that the warmer weather will soon be moving into Rhode Island and making it easier and more pleasant to eat lighter, fresher foods, I was nervous about how to actually plan and execute almost a whole month’s worth of gluten and casein free fare for us.

"It was all set to the primal rhythm of a steady thumping backbeat complemented by a bass line hitting you everywhere. It caused dancing of the simplest pattern; hop hop, switch foot, hop hop, switch foot, hop hop; arms swinging back and forth in time to the movement of the always bouncing feet. The grass was bright and green and standing when the man next to me started dancing this basic jungle influenced sway. By mid concert he had danced the grass flat, by nights end, to mud."

"This book just didn't do it for me, I'm sad to say. I think it does a good job in dealing with issues and questions that come up in the family dynamic. I liked that the point of view switches between each of Leah's family members instead of focusing on just the parents' viewpoint or just Leah's viewpoint. It showed how lack of communication and even miscommunication can create problems for a family. However, I like my fiction to have a balance. This book is just one depressing situation after another. Right after things start to seem a little better, another horrible thing happens. I will venture to say that most of our lives are filled with quite a bit of happy moments among the sad, frustrating moments, and I would have liked to see more of that."

After locating the car and returning it to their home, Cindy Anthony searched it and found a purse with information on a friend of Casey’s. Cindy asked the friend to take her to Casey’s boyfriend’s house. She confronted her daughter and demanded to see Caylee. They drove around for a while, then Casey finally admitted that she didn’t know where her daughter was. Returning to the Anthony family home, Cindy finally called police. Casey spoke to the 9-1-1 operator as well, and calmly told them that her daughter had been missing for four weeks, but she was afraid that her abilities as a mother would be questioned by authorities, and that is why she did not report the disappearance."

Be witty and charming and keep offensive opinions to yourself…. if you would like to be invited back), help clear the table (scrape the plates, rinse and stack. That’s enough.

First time writer/director, Warwick Thornton follows the film's two protagonists, a pair of Aboriginal kids living in a run-down community in Central Australia.

In fact, it was government policy that ‘Mother Tongue Education’ was compulsory for ALL RACES during the early formative primary school years.

I had never blown the insides out of an egg before without using specialized tools, but after googling how to do it and reading the first tutorial I came up with, I found out that it was pretty easy.

The eggs didn’t break."
"From the reptile store we hopped on a bus down to Jackson Square to hit the Farmer's Market for some lunch.

I find it extremely sweet, although that's not necessarily a bad thing after a spicy samosa!"

My hair is poker straight, won’t hold a curl and often has a mind of its own. It also can’t decide on what color it wants to be. It was blonde when I was really, really small. Then it was a mousey brown in early elementary school. Mid-elementary through my late teens it looked like it was chocolate brown until you got me in the light or sun and then I had a really dark auburn color."

"Historically server power benchmarks were not available and thus the only way for initial data center power planning was to rely on power data provided by system vendors in the form of faceplate values. But the use of faceplate value is flawed at the first place as it indicates the maximum power requirements for each component irrespective of its configuration or utilization. But the power consumption of a system is linearly correlated with its utilization. Because of this, a huge gap exists between the data center’s anticipated power require­ment and the actual power required by its equipment. Another option which is used is fixed de-rating where an arbitrarily percentage or number is subtracted from the nameplate value considering that the system’s faceplate rating is higher than its actual use. For example a 1,000 watt rated server would be de-rated by a fixed 20 percent which means you are assuming that it would consume 800 watts. However this is not true as its power consumption would be dependent on the utilization and estimated value most often is grossly inflated. As you might think, finding the correct percentage by which de-rating should be done is nearly impossible without any measurement tool. Two servers of the same manufacturer and model can consume different powers because of the utilization."

"Beatrice Shilling OBE, PhD, MSc, CEng was a highly talented aeronautical engineer - and motorcycle racer, gaining a Gold Star at Brooklands for her 106mph lap. She became hugely famous when she found an elegantly simple cure for the engine cutting-out problems experienced by Spitfire and Hurricane pilots when making extreme turns. It was a simple fuel-restriction device, like a washer with a needle valve, that was fitted into the SU carburettor and solved (nearly) the problem until pressurised carburettors were fitted to the Merlin engine. The little device became known as ""Tilly's orifice"" - and many of our brave fighter pilots owed their life to it."

It's chock full of loads of North American hops and has a sweet kick to it and a strong, pungent aroma that reminds some of cat piss. Others, such as Brown, of ""damp dishcloths"". For some in the room, it was their first experience of such a big beer. It was interesting watching peoples reactions. Some were instantly taken by it. Others, slowly won over by it."

But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. James 1:4 (KJV) You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. Hebrews 10:36 (NLT) “I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don’t tolerate evil people.” Revelation 2:2 (NLT) “I know all the things you do.

"Most gluten free bread is sold frozen. At best is is dense, and tastes funny. After moving to Austin, I went to the Whole Foods downtown for some lunch and shopping. The Whole Foods in Austin is HUGE. It is like a small city with several restaurants and lots of prepared foods. Anyway, we were in the bakery section, and I decided to ask someone stocking the baked goods if they had any gluten free bread. She pointed to a display where there were two kinds, white (potato flour) and whole grain (didn't notice, was too distracted by the white bread). I picked up the bread and it was SOFT! I teared up and yelled ""OMG it's soft!"" to my friend. I couldn't quite squeezing it and saying ""it's so soft!"" the whole time we were in the checkout. As soon as I got home, I opened the bag and ate a slice. It was amazing!"

"Georgians are also well-known for their friendliness and hospitality and I personally experienced this during my 2 visits. But closely watching over Tbilisi on one edge of the Narikala is the ‘Mother of Georgia’, a colossal statue of a lady holding a sword on one hand and a bowl of wine on the other. The wine symbolizes Georgia’s hospitality towards those who come as friends while the sword symbolizes the country’s readiness to quell those who come as enemies."

"It's easy to understand why. When it comes to value for money, vacation rentals including self catering options, they are small and more private space to yourself also makes it possible to spend as much as it would take for your transportation and sightseeing. You will have to worry about people partying or other disturbances around your own kitchen.

"If you have decided on your colour palette for the wedding, you should have a good idea of what colour your bridesmaids will be wearing. At that point, it is time to choose the bridesmaid dresses. Some women, when they think of a bridesmaid dress simply cringe, however with today’s new styles with charming ruffle trims, floral embellishments, flattering necklines, varied hemlines, and scope of fabric, there is no need to worry."

"Why did he let her leave, with his own back turned?"
"The first whiff is a clean, clear rye, much like the standard Sazerac, which yields to just a touch of fruit mixed in to the rye spice. The flavor is what grabs you right away. There is plenty of rye, but with a sweet, fruity note from the dessert wine, very unlike the sweetness you traditionally get from the corn in rye whiskey. Each sip is a mouthful of contrasting flavors - spicy and sweet, dry and fruity, whiskey and wine in perfect balance. The party continues into the finish. It's hard to believe that the few months this whiskey spent in the wine casks is enough to have such a pronounced influence on its character, but it can't be denied."
"Jerry Anomie was born in Tennessee but moved to Houston as a young child. Music never appealed to him growing up until a friend of his who worked at a record store played him the Sex Pistols and Iggy Pop. He ended up meeting Iggy soon after that, which helped give him a new outlook on life. Having recently spent five and a half years in prison, he started realizing he didn't have to be a criminal. He could be in a band!"

"What annoys me most of all is that upon being labelled a racist, you immediately refuted the claim and provided incontrovertible evidence of the opposite being true. Why wasn’t that the end of it? I too have Oriental help and, like you, am very fond of them. I like to give them a little slap on the buttocks as they clean my bidet in the home cinema and sometimes bow to them as they’re leaving for the day and say “ah so” as a show of cultural solidarity. I also found Mickey Rooney’s turn as Mr Fukkamoto (or whatever his name was) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s exceptionally funny, not because he ridicules Chinese/Japanese people, turning them into a preposterous caricature, but because he inhabits the role and brings out the inherent humanity of those two races. Why couldn’t people accept your affection for Asians on face value and move on? (Maybe next time mention Mickey Rooney.)"

Honey Irani appears in front of the camera in one of her first roles as an actress playing the mean and spoilt mommy’s girl Sheila. I love the way she stands and screams as an iron burns her sari rather than just lifting out a hand to move it away. She really does seem to believe she is the delicate flower her mother calls her and she wonderfully nasty towards her cousin. Ranjeet is appropriately sleazy and obviously the villain once he turns up in a selection of increasingly bad shirts and terrible scarves.

"OK, so this is supposed to be about getting a girlfriend fast……however, a common problem for single men (and indeed women) is that they are in way too much of a rush to find ‘the one’ because they are fed up with the dating game.

First and foremost, it’s become a great tool to keep myself on track and accountable, but it also provides a therapeutic way to process my feelings, figure out solutions, and track my progress. The fact that it’s become a daily destination for so many people looking for a little inspiration, honesty, laughter, or whatever… well, it astounds me. It’s a great source of pride. Thanks to this blog, I’ve been able to connect with and learn from so many wonderful people all over the planet, and that astounds me too!"
Having observed the assignment desk area with the NFL Network- I know how diligent they are with their breaking news. I am sure that they saw the news hit as soon as we did. I’m also sure they began calling everyone from police to team contacts for a confirmation and refused to report the news until they had solid facts confirmed.

"Therefore, taking into account that the thesis that is presented by the first Defendant, through the adequate means that are placed at his disposal by the other Defendants, raises the suspicion of the involvement of the first and second Applicants in the practice of criminal actions, albeit in a negligent way, among the general public, and that they, having been made arguidos at a given point in time, saw the criminal inquiry archived in relation to them, one has to conclude that it must be the rights of the Defendants that cede to the rights of the Applicants."
"Once upon a time, there was a red cell phone. It was an LG EnV3 that wasn’t really red, but maroon, and it belonged to Bekah. Every day, it faithfully did its job. It took her phone calls and collected her text messages. It rang and beeped mostly appropriately so that she would know to respond to the other people trying to contact her. Most of the time, the phone even maintained a good relationship with the Jawbone Bluetooth unit. They were hardly ever not on speaking terms, working in tandem so that Bekah could multitask and use her phone while driving. Life was good for the red cell phone. Many thought provoking discussions were facilitated by it, and even more encouraging and informative text messages were passed along by it."

I loved that Julia Quinn created this cinderella tale within the Bridgerton series. Although the book you were hoping that Benedict would see but he doesn’t well that is until the very end.
"In terms of plot, the book is well executed. Amy and J. C. hunt for the murderer and make some interesting discoveries along the way. When I found out who the killer was, I had a kind of duh moment but it didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the novel. I was interested in knowing how J. C. and Amy would trap the killer and how the killer managed to evade detection for so long. In some ways, the story’s evolution and world reminded me of Christine Feehan’s Ghostwalkers series or Jayne Castle’s novels (which is a compliment to my mind), though there are enough differences that the comparison was fleeting."
"When she isn't tapping away at her keyboard, Margaret engages in an epic battle against her never-ending laundry hampers, cajoles the flowers in her yard, sings into her hairbrush, and has been known to hold entire conversations speaking only in movie quotes."

"Overtime it is. Five minutes or sudden death.The toss is to our advantage, Thunder have the wind behind and the slight slope to speed the ball."
"The Jeffersonian Constitution has been misrepresented as much as or more than Jeffersonian philosophy. It was not “strict construction,” a nonstarter, nor even states’ rights. It was state sovereignty. Jefferson (and Madison, too) may be quoted ad infinitum to this effect. The Virginia and Kentucky documents of 1798-1800 spell out beyond any doubt that the final defense of freedom in the American system is the people acting in their only constitution-making identity, that of their sovereign states. The states were the legitimate and peaceful resort to protect the liberties of their citizens and themselves as communities from federal encroachment."

"Chris Mann from Team Christina finally returned to his opera roots, singing Ave Maria. As a not big fan, I was surprised because he almost won me over with this performance. His control and power and grace are undeniable, and this was definitely my favorite of his performances. I hope he sticks with more opera/classic songs that aren’t too ballad-y next week, songs that he can really go all out on without sounding too cliché."

"Despite Romney’s well-established ability to shape shift his positions on any number of issues or topics, depending what audience he’s talking to at the time, he’s worked hard to put himself into a corner on lending even a pittance of pity to union workers in general and public union workers specifically. His antagonistic attitude toward government at all levels, especially the federal government, promising to take an ax to it if he’s elected, seems to working against him in Ohio, where public union workers, their family, friends and supporters, have not only not forgotten the battle they waged last year over SB 5, the bill that would have effectively gutted collective bargaining as its been successfully practiced for nearly 30 years, but appear ready to send another message to those who want to rub out unions by voting for the President."

"Jurors heard recordings of those conversations this afternoon. In a June 9th 2010 conversation, Steele is heard agreeing to give Fairfax a $400 advance to pay for his trip to Oregon City, where Cyndi Steele was visiting her mother. However, Edgar Steele continues to contest the authenticity of the recordings, and one person posting a comment to this story maintains that audio experts identified 351 edits on these manufactured tapes. Unfortunately, the judge earlier ruled the two experts could not testify. Fairfax's testimony will continue on Thursday April 28th."

"The words of Carl Jenkinson underline the impact of one result, the ensuing wobble understandable. With the injury list at any one point in time containing a number of key experienced personnel, to have returned to form twice in one season is of great credit. Finding that consistency over the full campaign is the next step, a stride that has proven too great for some previous groups of Arsenal players in the last decade."
"I eat a healthy diet. I’ve been vegetarian for 10 years, and I recently became a vegan, due to some digestive issues and a possible link with my MTHFR polymorphism.

"My card base is kraft, with a mat of ivory, and then some ""chic"" dp bought at Mike's pad. Didn't show who put it out because I used part of it previously and so the name is gone..sorry people. It's a soft denim colored blue and ivory so I wanted to bring that out in my flower. After cutting the different size flowers I brushed them with denim colored ink that Adirondack puts out. Now for some fun I used the Scor-Pal and did a bit of pleating out of the ivory card stock and then added some crocheted ribbon stuff to give it that vintage look. Guess I need to use some of that on myself to add to my vintage look (mine is wrinkled skin and old age spots) not so classy, me thinks. After I slapped it together I added the little flag sentiment ""thank-you"" found in the Hello Hyacinth set. Put a few blingers on and I'm through here.So now it's your turn to get a bag (not a live one like me) and see what you can come up with.

"Like I mentioned, I’ve been big on getting cheese from the remnant or manager special box at bloomingfoods. The cheeses I’ve gotten recently are goat gouda, cocoa dusted cardona, and kentucky blue cheese. The remnant section is great because it gives you a chance to try a cheese you may not normally. It also allows you to have an expensive cheese for a fraction of the cost and without the fear of it going moldy in the fridge. Plus, if you’re cooking for one, you can make a small chunk of cheese last a for a few meals. If you’ve never had cardona before, I would suggest looking for it. It’s apparently an artisanal goat cheese from Wisconsin. The creator of it got the idea from one of his favorite sandwiches- a piece of swiss cheese and a hershey bar on bread. I can barely detect the cocoa in this cheese, fortunately. Anyway, I know a lot of people are leery to buy food that is marked down to sell. I’ve never had a problem, though, and it certainly beats paying full price."

"My baby is two years old today! Moms always tell me time with kids flies by. I believe them, and it seems to be so much more true as adoptive parents. Even though we met Zane when he was 16 months old, we feel like we've been his parents forever. In some ways it's like he's always been here, but in other ways, like today, it feels like I've only had him for a few short weeks. I'm not ready for him to be two already. It still seems like we just came home with him."
"A rambutan has that crazy sort of alien fruit look. It’s spiky tentacles are actually quite soft to the touch and make it even more exotic in appearance. Once red, these peel off easily with the skin which is a little woody, but pliable. You can break the skin with a knife or your fingernail and peel it back revealing a juicy translucent globe. There’s a clear seed inside which can be avoided once you bite into it or you can cut it out.So how does it taste? I found it to be a little bit melon-like but with the texture of a ripe grape. It sort of reminds me of a lychee, but not many people have tried that either so I don’t know if that helps. It doesn’t really drip juices, but seems like it should. Depending on the ripeness of the fruit, it can vary in sweetness, but I’ve yet to taste one that gives an unripe sensation; however, an overripe one can seem a little bit fermented. These are fun, but maybe a little too extreme to be seen regularly in a kid’s lunchbox. They can seem expensive, but there’s very little waste and it’s not like you’ll eat dozens of them. It’s a fun treat in the world of interesting fruit."

"You're trying to write a novel in a hurry. That means you can't afford to spend too much time sitting staring into space looking for inspiration. Whether you're an outline writer or strictly seat-of-the-pants, I'd recommend keeping at least a rough list of cool ideas that you might put in. Start noting stuff down sometime in September and keep the list to hand. Every time you find yourself staring off into space in November, the first thing you do is check the list."

One of them is even a Scottish Lord from Days of Our Lives! the humanoid Replicators have not quite hit T-1000 territory yet, but there are hints of their malleability and some mind reading powers. They are modeled after Reese, so they possess her flaw. The SG-1 team cons one of the more advanced models into betraying the others by convincing him their flaw is too dangerous to let them off world to reproduce. They plan to reverse the time device back to the way the Asgard intended and take him with them, but in reality, he becomes frozen in time with the others because even he is deemed too dangerous."

"...the school's so-called hidden curriculum, subtle presentations of political or cultural ideas, imparts important cultural values. School activities such as spelling bees and sports encourage competition and showcase success. Children also receive countless messages that their society's culture is both practically and morally good.Taught to think our culture is both ""practically and morally good,"" is it any wonder that things continue to be so bad? If our culture is good, then there's obviously no need to change things in any real or radical way. The same book also goes on to say that ""schools further socialize young people into culturally approved gender roles,"" something that, as a person who often chooses to identify as a feminist, and has a good handful of queer friends, disturbs me on multiple levels."

"But others come to Italy to stay. They set down roots and become part of the local colourful scenery. They are looked upon kindly by neighbours especially with regard to food and fashion and child-rearing (Oh but how can they know? They are foreigners!) Or they are regarded with deep and unfeeling suspicion. I know that when I moved here with my mixed children and mud-splattered car and unruly red hair and, every so often, a wild summer party, my neighbours decided that I was a hippie and a drug addict (WHAAT? HIPPIES DON'T WEAR DIOR). It was even whispered at my kids' school that I had had my four children with four different fathers. Can you imagine dealing with four exes?? Pluh-eeze."

In her eyes, Jeanne always felt the cruises were about all of you and not about her.

She was proud that her trips were like no other cruises, just as her Quackers were like no others."

"The goals you have in life, the major ones that is, are hard to grasp sometimes. They seem so far away, like we come so far only to go even further and it always seem just out of reach. Today, you need to stop looking at where the goal is, but where you are and be proud of how far you come. For example, my business, four years ago it was looking on the verge of death and we were pretty scared here. One by one new clients came in and every month we got better, then every year we became more stable, till finally this year we got too much work and needed to grow. We are still not where we want to be, but I will take where we are and proud of what we did to make it."
"There isn’t much of this going on in today’s world! There is a lot of fixin’ our thoughts on things that are none of these. You hear parents yelling at their kids for foul language, when the kids get it from their parents; you see people at work trying to get by with whatever they can, instead of working to the fullest of their ability; society is full of pornography – not only the hard stuff that wrecks marriages and families, but soft porn, watched on tv, seen at the movies, displayed on magazine pages until we become immunized to its effects; fidelity in relationships or marriages is thrown out the window – after all, if it’s kept hidden, it’s ok, right?; violence in video games, movies, loss of life taken lightly – we are honoring the horrors that our military face on a regular basis – things that mess with their heads for the rest of their lives; bodies are thrown from one lover to the other for instant gratification; babies are ripped from their mother’s womb, deemed an inconvenience from a sexual act that most likely should not have taken place anyhow; deceit is prevalent all around as times are hard and people fear for their survival, yet refuse to let God handle it all; lying is used to get us out of anything we don’t want to deal with; rage runs rampant from the highways to our homes. The list goes on and on…."

"I saw this on Yahoo, April 30 1945 was when a great evil committed suicide rather than be captured by the Soviet troops that were closing in on the Reichtag and the Chancellor building. The German garrison at Berlin were contesting every block with the Soviets but there were more Soviets with combat training and far fewer Germans, the Germans fought with fanaticism born of fear and desperation, the Soviet reprisals against the German civilians were well documented when German troops earlier had recaptured some German territory in Vistula, the gang rape and executions were documented by photo's and survivor eye witnesses. The German troops fought to buy time for the civilians to escape and of the false hope of all the wonder weapons and reinforcements that were promised by Geobbels the propaganda minister.

The Moroccan one has coriander (cilantro) cumin, chilli flakes, black pepper corns, and the Italian has chilli flakes, oregano, onions flakes and garlic flakes and black pepper corns. The Citrus is just the zest of two lemons dried in the microwave and added to the rock salt then ground in my little electric grinder."

"Volume 16, released earlier this month, starts in Tokyo, where a foreigner called Judy is planning to get married to a Japanese lad. His family, and especially his grandfather, is opposed. Basically, the whole volume traces an arc towards her final acceptance by his family. But the clever bit is that the story echoes the relationship between Rita and Masataka Taketsuru, the founder of the Nikka whisky (of which more here). Taketsuru's marriage to Rita, a Scottish woman, was at first not welcomed by his family (or her's) but they lived out their lives together in Japan. The story of Rita and Masataka is introduced near the end of the manga and resonates with the modern couple's experience."

To be the first Venezuelan to win a Formula One race is a big honour and hopefully I will win more races in the future."

"Rhythm is a very good thing...until it is not. I have missed some very great bargains following that rhythmic “get the heck out of here” mall march in my head. Getting on a bad rhythm is different than a bad habit. A bad habit is a single behaviour that you repeat regardless of the knowledge that it is doing you no good. Rhythm is how we have learned to flow through our days we don’t think about it, it just propels us along developing a bad rhythm is easier than you think. Good or bad that rhythm you've developed is a comfort to you. I learned that way back in design school. White pillow, blue pillow, white pillow, blue pillow, is the subconscious calmer. The 'thing' in the room that you can't quite put your finger on that gives you a sense of peace and comfort. It does not matter if the material is ugly and hard on the eyes; gross pillow, ugly pillow, gross pillow, ugly pillow has the same calming effect as pretty pillow, cute pillow, pretty pillow, cute pillow. It is the rhythm that makes you feel good."

"And the other nice thing about letting go of the lifestyle and just loving GOD and others is that it tends to eliminate the gray areas that we Christians run into. Rather than looking at something and struggling over whether it's right or wrong, black or white, you're faced with this question of if whatever it is you want to do will be loving to GOD and/or loving to others."

If you consider the red dragon on the Welsh flag, it makes perfect sense that Arthur Pendragon - the “head dragon” - should have lived and ruled there.

The sooner we get off the reserve, the sooner they push the Land Management Agreement on us, & the sooner we accept these and start living in the cities or start selling our land then the agreements that were signed over a hundred years ago will be null and void. We as a people, with our Aboriginal rights and Treaty rights will cease to exist, and this would make the government really happy. So take these cuts for what they are an attack on us as a people. So pick up your pen or whatever and write a letter to the Minister of Health, write to your local MP’s these are just the cuts we can see, what about the ones that we won’t see until we have to see a doctor and need medication or worse a medical procedure and we have to shell out. Enough is enough! Let’s not sit back and be passive about these things anymore. If we let them get away with this we open the door for more, cuz if you give the government an inch they are gonna take a mile.

"We moved, we survived and now I split my time between London and Provence with visits to Australia whenever I can. If you ask me today where home is I will say France but whenever I am talking about London or Australia I will also refer to them as home. My children would consider their home to be in London although they are very comfortable in France and are true Australians. I have come to realize that home can be as many places as you want it to be. Our home in Provence has captured my heart – from the very first day I saw it I have been smitten. London was another matter all together; it was not love at first sight. London and all it's wonders has crept up on me. I would say that many years passed before I felt that London held a place for me... I was 'being' and 'doing'... going through the motions... but without a real sense of belonging... Now I feel engaged with the city and I look forward to my time spent there each year..."

"Quinoa (pronounced “keen-wah”) seems to be one of the hottest new food trends, increasingly showing up on restaurant menus, recipe sites and grocery shelves. But quinoa has actually been around for centuries and can be traced back to ancient Peru.

Yep, that’s right, quinoa grows right here in Colorado so it is another great option for CO Locavores."

"The current Alberta Energy Ministry’s policy is to consult with aboriginal groups when development has the potential to adversely affect traditional uses and their constitutionally protected rights to hunt, trap, and fish. The provincial government stands by their stance that is does not consult with First Nation at the preliminary lease-granting stage because there are many steps to go before tar sands development actually occurs. Currently, the government’s policy is to simply post lease sales online and not consult directly with First Nations."

"But rescuing the emperor is not enough. Ichiro soon realizes the only way to save the universe is to reach the Bridge of Heaven, located on the island of Hokkaido, the home of the barbarian Ainu. Only then can he hope to bring the sacred sword, the sacred mirror, and the sacred jewel together to restore the Emperor’s power and divine status. Assuming, of course, that he can defeat Taira’s naval forces and somehow close the demonic gateway through which the forces of chaos might escape to overwhelm everything. That, however, will require Ichiro to enter Yomi, the very domain of Death itself…"

"Viking design emphasized intertwining, sinuous shapes, usually detailing animals and often including people. The Vikings often incorporated legend into their art. The stave churches are a particularly valuable part of the Norwegian architectural heritage, and are considered to be of national and global importance. There are several types of stave churches but the common element to all of them is that they have corner-posts (“staves”) and a skeleton or framework of timber with wall planks standing on sills. These walls are known as stave walls, hence the name stave church."

It feels like someone is stabbing a knife in my ear drum and waggling it about a bit. It's felt like that for three days. It has given me toothache in a way that I don't really understand. It has left me deaf in my right ear and confused my sense of balance. But the cruelest trick is that the pain is ten times worse if I lie down. Which is making sleep tricky.

"rolls and table look-ups can get rather tedious at times. For a successful hit there are 2 die rolls (roll to hit, roll damage) and you have to look up the hit location on a table. That's not so bad, but for a critical hit there are 3 rolls and 3 tables to consult. Add in the math necessary for figuring actual damage by subtracting the target's toughness and armor and it all gets a bit much to handle for 6 pcs and 8 beastmen late at night."

"Having said all this, I wouldn’t want to push the similarities between the two films’ characters too far. There are also important differences. Elsie in The Prince and the Showgirl is less ambitious and rather more likeable than her 1950s male counterpart, partly because of Terence Rattigan’s great script, adapted from his own play The Sleeping Prince, and partly because Monroe herself gives the character so much warmth. You never feel that Elsie is on the make, trying to work out whether the Prince could help her career – whereas I do think there is this feeling occasionally in My Week with Marilyn. Colin had appeared to be falling in love with costume assistant Liz (Emma Watson), but he quickly drops her when it becomes apparent that Marilyn Monroe might be interested. Liz herself suggests to him that he sees a possibility of trading up, and he doesn’t deny this. I suppose another way of seeing this is that Elsie is really falling in love with her Prince, even if their hoped-for reunion in 18 months’ time seems likely to be just a dream – but Colin’s flirtation with Marilyn will just be one week out of his life, something for him to remember, and trade on, later. Redmayne is excellent at making Colin genuine and kind, but at times showing a hint of calculation below the charm."

"This is, of course, based on a Neil Gaiman novel (he’s also credited as producer). I am, mutatis mutandis, a fan of Gaiman’s work, and the writers of Stardust (Vaughn and Jane Goldman) have worked hard to ensure it sits easily within the canon. Gaiman’s schtick, to the extent that he has one, is to combine classic story themes and ideas with a modern, often knowing sensibility – taking them seriously but not often sending them up. But while it’s smart and funny, Stardust is really lacking in the darkness it probably needs to convince as a genuine fairy tale – much of the time it’s desperately whimsical, occasionally bordering on the twee. It should really be as annoying as hell and the fact that it isn’t is to Vaughn’s credit."

"The problem with the second statistic is that it is very clearly illogical. Agents earn their income from commissions on sales--i.e., they get paid only if they sell something. If agents sold only 1 in every 100 manuscripts they represented, they couldn't make enough money to keep their doors open--except maybe the disreputable ones who charge fees. (Nor, with so few sales, is it likely that trade publishers would be able to churn out over 300,000 new titles a year in the USA alone.) And imagine the work load, if for every success you also had to market 99 duds! No agent will manage to sell every single manuscript--but no agent could possibly remain in business with such a high failure rate."

"As I said, it was initially hard for me to envision a zombie novel as a romance. However, either Marion’s writing changed my perception or love really does affect us all – living or undead. Marion can relate to our uncertainties about a romantic zombie. “I didn’t want to sanitize him into something I called a zombie,” Marion says. “You watch him kill people and eat people and do horrific things zombies do. There’s a germ of change in there, so you hear him give his distaste for things but this is what we do."

"The short story I read was The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster (which I believe is available for free online and in e-book format). I read it as part of my ongoing interest in dystopian and apocalyptic literature, and while Forster has some disturbing insights into future life that could easily be applied in today’s world, the story doesn’t have much in the way of plot or characters; it’s more of a platform for Forster to get across some of his ideas. It’s still worth reading, though, if you are interested in how authors envision the future."

"Like a lot of other bands, they straddle the line between pagan metal and black metal (if it's really a line at all), using very few folk elements. They play at a mid-pace for black metal, allowing their very catchy riffs to sink in (see especially ""Waldeinsamkeit""), while the drums never go into blast-beat territory, instead opting for a fast but steady pace with some fills. Most of the vocals are rasped, but there are some more melodic vocal styles in here as well. Which brings me to some of the surprises."
"Unfortunately, though, it's Sacha's head that catches the attention of the picky Baron (he was rather taken by his pronounced Serbian nose). Removing it with a pair of specially designed head clippers, the Baron and his lab assistant leave Nicholas unconscious on the side of the road next to Sacha's now headless body. Groggy and confused (he was out cold before his pal's head was chopped off), Nicholas wanders off to meet with Baroness Katrin Frankenstein, an eyebrowless vixen played by Monique van Vooren (Sugar Cookies). Yeah, that's right, he has an appointment to see the Baron's wife and sister (they have two kids together) at their castle. You see, before the head lopping incident, Nicholas and the Baroness were constantly running into one another. And since her brother won't impale her vaginal tract with his aristocratic penis anymore, she decides to hire the strapping stableboy as her new man servant/boy-toy."

"He stepped out of the car and looked skyward. It’s about forty-five degrees, sky full of stars, no clouds, but snow,” he thought. He peeled off his fingerless gloves before reaching into the air to catch a flake as it descended. He looked at it, but light was scarce. He checked up to see that the nearest street light was four houses away, then glanced again up into the starry night. He watched star after star disappear as if a black blanket was being pulled across the night sky, eventually leaving an empty ceiling. He blindly reached through the open car window while watching where the stars had been only seconds ago. He clicked on the spotlight that was mounted just above his side view mirror and held his palm in front of the beam."

"Talking to those who are already in the market will help you find out what’s a good rate for your work, as I’ve done. In my talks I’ve found that the going hourly is $25 (USD) and those with a network of clients earn significantly more. But if I were to come in and say $15 an hour, a very liveable wage here, would severely hurt everyone else and my future prospects. It would create the expectation that writing is only worth that much, which if I’m writing 1000 words an hour equates to 6.66 cents a word. I earn that for a short submission to some of the local publications."

Let me remind you, yet again, though it seems excessive, it is necessary to fully implement due diligence and determine whether someone really does qualify for a loan. The underwriter usually gets blamed for declining a loan, regardless of what the issues are and just recently something was written online about Real Estate Agencies requesting less strict underwriting guidelines. After all we have been through as a Nation, let alone the many homeowners who could face never owning another home, how could anyone request something like this?"

We punched holes in a milk jug and watched the water shoot out father from the bottom hole than the top hole. We also poked a hole in the bottom of one cup and the side of another to demonstrate that pressure is in all directions. I thought this would be rather simplistic, but I underestimated boys' fascination with water."

"Cap looks a tad cheesy, but his costume is impossible to film. The buccaneer boots will never work. Chris Evans seemed a bit restrained in this movie, the stiff personality of Steve Rogers maybe getting lost a smidge among all the goofballs on the team.

"This article in the nyt last month makes a good argument as to one cause. Agricultural subsidies are primarily directed towards a few crops, including corn and soybeans. This makes the goods derived from these crops, such as high fructose corn syrup, cheaper, while making other produce, such as carrots, oranges, etc more expensive. This means that healthier food ends up being a luxury good."

Seeing that Peter Sellers released it in 1957 perhaps someone should have a word with Steptoe and Son and tell them that only last year music copyright laws were extended from fifty to seventy years… The Performing Rights Society might also take an interest as they’re pumping it out like a Radio 1 Roadshow.

Of course, I got there as soon as I could. I have photos to share that I'll be uploading soon. What I will try to relate as well is the feeling of incredible love and hope that exists today for those on the forefront of fighting AIDS and discrimination for HIV+ people. What I learned about this disease, now in the 25th year since its discovery, shook me deeply and also made my eyes fill with tears of compassion for the people who live with this illness on some level daily."

"Nothing quite screams out ""Summer is on its way!"" more than the appearance of the Poinciana flowers. I've been very pleased to see these gorgeous red flowers this year. Last summer none of my Poincianas bloomed much at all, but that was probably as a direct result of the rather out-of-the-ordinary rain we received during our supposedly 'dry' season. Poincianas like the dry and they seem to bloom so much better when the dry season is very, very dry."
"I wouldn’t ever want to hurt them, but sometimes I wish I was the kind of person who would just do it upfront and not really care. But then again, that I don’t do cruel things like that is just about the only salvageable aspect of my personality, so I wouldn’t actually do it even if I could."
"Ideas alone cannot have any effect. They are simply information and evil people know this. That is why conditions are set up in the physical world to empower those ideas and hence trick the other person into believing them. And let me specify here again that empowered ideas are not ones that the evil people can present as some potent weapon being thrown at the victim from them. Evil people have no mental powers. Empowered ideas only means that lame ideas are presented at such time and in such a way as to find fertile soil. The victim is upholding beliefs together with changes to their body function, which occur simultaneously with the ideas presented, so as to make those ideas appear as powerful ideas. They are not. It is all about deceit and really a dramatic puppet show stitched together, a cut and paste exercise. With this in mind we can then appreciate that to generate barrier or resistance cells in the body (what doctors call cancer cells) there needs to be harmful ideas presented in the mind that are empowered because of the condition of the targeted person/ the victim; and for all that to occur when the targeted person is angry and hostile. When a person is angry and hostile they will hold a misguided volition with respect to those ideas as to struggle with them. However finding no clear and definable aggressor with which to struggle, which is their plan A, they go to plan B. In Plan B their volition becomes the desire to build a barrier or shield for protection against the mysterious aggressor. The theatre of war seems to be in the body, so the barrier that can be built can only ever be a cell barrier, which of course grow bigger and bigger the harder they struggle and fight until a mass is formed. This mass doctors call cancer."

"John and I talked several times before I could finally convince him to come out and see the house and the ongoing remodel. Over time, he told us stories about how special the house was for him all those years before; how it changed his life. He was only 28 years old when he designed it, as a “moonlighting” job. He described how he rocked his kids to sleep with his foot while he was drawing the plans, late at night. (Plans we now have, drawn with pencil on a rice paper of some kind.) John explained that the house changed his career, gave him the momentum he needed to start his own firm. He spoke very"
"As quickly as our snow came, it left and here it is January tenth and it's still fifty degrees outside. Tonight the kids played outside while I cooked dinner which doesn't even seem possible.

God I feel stupid when people talk about jet streams."
"Don’t take our word for it. Here’s what the late Richard Rorty, one of the most prominent post-modern philosophers of the 20th century, said on the subject:"
"I know what I need to do, in fact I have written it all down and have a recipe book to pull from ever meal that I need to create, cook and eat so that my body is fueled correctly. I know how to workout and in fact I crave it but with my current stress levels and lack of what I would call free time to get out there and bust ass, I am as I stated struggling to get back in the game as it were. Am I still riding my bike? Absofuckinloutly! that is something that I won't stop doing as its one of the things in life where I find pure joy but I am not in fact riding enough. I haven't ridden during the week in months, My only riding takes place on the weekend with a riding buddy and that's approximately 20 to 25 miles at a go which is as I said not enough."
"But more than the art, I was amazed to see the style of the women and men… all the fashion was amazing, and people are so elegant and confident, women are beautiful and men are so hot!! It’s too bad that most of my pictures from that time were lost when my notebook was stollen… so all I’ve got left is a few pics, but not enough to show some street style, so I just chose these about some styles I was wearing."
And mouth with myriad subtleties.
"After a bit, she wanted to go on the swings. Not the big girl swings but the baby ones. The one Ashlin was in last time we were there. Fine. Ashlin is staying in the stroller. I wasn’t allowed to push her though. Weird kid. Eventually she wanted to get out, so we did the wiggle, wiggle, wiggle dance to get her out of the too-small swing. The slightly wet sand under the swings was the next source of gravity, and she crouched down to grab a handful. And peed her pants."
"Naturally, I assumed she meant to say, ""Liberty won't HELP me clean."" The two girls had been working on cleaning their bedroom all. day. long. So I called into the other room, ""Liberty, help your sister clean!"""
I am a long way from this promised state.
"Where local policies contribute is property. As rent rises, so too do food prices. Supermarkets need to charge more to maintain inventory, and hawkers need to pay their stall rent. The practice of subletting hawker stalls is especially problematic: That’s when a stall holder pays maybe $700 a month for the stall, but charges someone $2000 a month to operate it. Wave at Holland Village, people."
"The most chaste daughter of Maharaja Drupada and partly an incarnation of goddess Saci, the wife of Indra. Maharaja Drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja. By his first offering, Dhrstadyumna was born, and by the second offering, Draupadi was born. She is therefore the sister of Dhrstadyumna, and she is also named Pancali. The five Pandavas married her as a common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. Maharaja Yudhisthira begot a son named Pratibhit, Bhimasena begot a son named Sutasoma, Arjuna begot Srutakirti, Nakula begot Satanika, and Sahadeva begot Srutakarma. She is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, Kunti. During her birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called Krsna. The same message also declared that she was born to kill many a ksatriya. By dint of her blessings from Sankara, she was awarded five husbands, equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She was married with the Pandavas during their exile in the forest, but when they went back home Maharaja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dhrtarastra. When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by Duhsasana to see her naked beauty, even though there were elderly persons like Bhisma and Drona present. She was a great devotee of Lord Krsna, and by her praying, the Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the name Jatasura kidnapped her, but her second husband, Bhimasena, killed the demon and saved her. She saved the Pandavas from the curse of Maharsi Durvasa by the grace of Lord Krsna. When the Pandavas lived incognito in the palace of Virata, Kicaka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement with Bhima the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by Asvatthama. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband Yudhisthira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhisthira, but when Yudhisthira entered the heavenly planet he saw Draupadi gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet."

Some of the points that the Summer Matters site talks about are family time (though many families have two or are single-parent working and the summer doesn’t change that since the kids are still in the care of others during the day), childhood growth and development (which is currently ousted in favor of having children study more to boost standardized test scores) and the economy of seasonal communities (which really only matters if you’re among the top income brackets – we poor folks don’t really contribute much to the seasonal economy since we’re too busy worrying about budgeting this week’s grocery bill to plan a vacation to a touristy hot spot)."

"Enhanced eBooks are on everyone’s lips, yet there is no general consensus on what an ebook has to have to be considered an “enhanced” ebook.

One thing we noted during our stay in Ireland was how laid back everyone was. It was refreshing to note that no one was interested in getting us out of a restaurant or pub so that they could turn the table over. Throughout our journey we were never rushed and allowed to sit and enjoy our dinner at each establishment and were never rushed out the door. It was refreshing when you consider the United States where everything is about getting people in and out of a restaurant with no consideration of the flow of the meal.

I have a personalized aisle runner to mark the aisle and to protect my dress from the ground, my mother is going to help me decorate a wedding arch for the ceremony to take place under, and I made flower cones to hang at the end of each row of seats for an added bit of decoration to my aisle. I opted to make flower cones because they are different from standard pew bows, and I think they add a nice touch. They are also extremely easy to make and cost effective. For eight flower cones, I purchased eight sheets of cardstock at 25 cents a sheet, and four spools of ribbon, on clearance, for 97 cents each for a grand total of just under six dollars. My inspiration for making flower cones is from this site, although I ended up making my own subtle changes."
"It would be redundant of me to point out the obvious evil of the “modern” progressive crusade to save the world from itself, when the political correctness plague with which this movement is infected, is currently so pervasive at every level of society. It is an infection of psychological origin, a contagious mental illness, and it is spread by the main stream media through dissemination of certain key phrases that mutate into gross distortions of basic fact each and every time they are repeated. The carriers of this disease are those lonely souls who follow societal trends in order to fit in, and who desire nothing more than to be on the winning team. They make it a point to know all the buzzwords associated with the cause they support, but not the origin of the sound-bytes they parrot. They are quick to criticize opposition to their dogma, and resort to ad hominid attacks when confronted with irrefutable fact. They are unaware of their illness, and perceive anyone that disagrees with their view as uninformed, and generally all the more needful of their “help”."
"Budweiser is fit for a mates house party or at a club, fits with a guys image, little in terms of taste to offend or surprise the consumer and hard to spill so long as its kept in the bottle. Budvar is a little more reserved and almost an opposite in terms of setting. This would be more acceptable at a dinner table or in a nice pub with a few salty snacks to help it go down. This beer also has much more flavour, less carbonisation and is far more complimented when poured into a glass."

"No one should be more surprised that the Tories take money from rich people, who then get the ear of the Government, than that the Tories, and their Liberal clones, last week, pushed through a Budget that also favoured the rich, and further attacked ordinary working people. Society is not divided into just two Classes, but it is divided into two great ""Class Camps"", as Marx put it in the Communist Manifesto. That is the Camp of Capital and the Camp of Labour. The Liberal-Tories represent the former, and Labour should represent the latter. There is nothing wrong, or surprising, then in the rich, and the representatives of Capital, giving money to the Liberal-Tories in return for them pursuing policies in their interests, any more than there is anything wrong with workers, through their union subscriptions, or through individual subscriptions, paying money to Labour for the same reason."
"Though as this is taught to be possible to do, you are also said to likely bump into sinister beings who will try to mislead you from the path. These teachings explain how to transform yourself into a spiritual being and every spiritual being that exists is said to have done this work, have transformed themselves into beings of light. The sinister beings are also said to have made themselves into the way they are, have transformed themselves into beings of darkness. And when you call on a Master in the astral, the sinister beings are said to sometimes come to you, trying to pretend that they are the Master and try to mislead you. I have heard stories of this and people say that sometimes it is very obvious, like the sinister being is trying to look like the Master, but fails so hard to do so. Anyway, there are recitations that one can do which are said to get rid of any sinister being. This can be used to get rid of them and also to check whether or not you are encountering a spiritual being or if it is a sinister being. As sinister beings are said to disappear when doing these recitations, the spiritual beings do not."
"This just is not the way to follow up a classic film - it isn't done in the same visual style, it doesn't have the same level of acting, it hasn't got ONE SONG in the whole thing, and it's more likely to provoke nightmares than wonder. Fairuza Balk plays it more like Indiana Jones than Judy Garland, and she's acting alongside special effects 75% of the time. Running through some poppies would probably have helped the situation."

It dawned on me that they would have many thousands of life experiences without me. Until that point, I thought I would be part of every aspect of their lives and see and feel everything they did. It came as a rude shock when at 5 they were already, in a sense, on their own and experiencing life without me. It was at that moment I knew that my role had changed. I was simply a caretaker to watch over them as they did their own growing into adults."

"The traffic light and the traffic policeman is a common sight on every crossing. Oprah Winfrey, when she visited India recently and travelled across Mumbai, and later between Delhi and Agra, wondered what they were for. The mystery is yet to be solved. It is somewhat like figuring out why there is a Queen in England. I believe they are there because it is a tradition to have traffic lights (four) and traffic policeman (one) – a convention, without which the city roads would look less like roads, and more like lanes or highways. In some parts of India the traffic cop cuts a sorry figure, being abused and ignored; at others he is an evil character, stopping vehicles randomly, for his ‘cut’. (A ‘cut’ is a type of a tax imposed in India; the concept of this tax cannot be explained in this article.)"

"Often when it comes to sex, we get in our own way (in our modern culture and society), because there is so much social judgment about sex. It can take YEARS for a person to let go of all their hang ups and actually discover their own individual sexuality. So if you’re the partner who has been worried about porn – perhaps it’s time for you to watch some (alone) to see if you actually do dislike it… or if there is perhaps something about it that works for you too! Once you let go of concerns or feelings of guilt &/or shame – you may find that it excites you too. If so – problem solved! If not, so what? We’re complex creatures, we’re not all wired the same, so there’s no guarantee that you will become a porn lover… but there are LOTS of kinds of porn, so perhaps there is a type that works for YOU."

"The first time was back in early September. I was meandering through the aisles, loading up on cake baking supplies and snacks for my son’s lunch box. His birthday was coming, and he had just started full-day school days. I was weepy as I was wandering, still in the thick of the “letting go” process. It was hard for me to stomach him being under someone else’s charge, and apparently it was hard for him, too, as he was exhibiting some spikes in bad behavior. I wanted to wrap him up and tuck him away from the world, but I knew that I would not be able to shield him from “real life” forever. It made my heart crack."

One night, I struck up a conversation with the person next to me and turns out, he was a Chicago Cubs fan just like me, and grew up in Holland, MI. I had actually been to Holland, MI for a collegiate cross-country race so we talked a little about the town, and what it was like for him to grow up there. One of the many great things about beer is that it brings strangers together."

"However, the day we moved in (Wednesday) was the day the stove top arrived. The workers were here converting the stove to propane gas while we were moving in. After the workers left the ""boss"" builder stopped by to inspect their work and the damn stove exploded. Like blue flame, the knobs flew off, and the boss about lost it (after he raced to turn off the gas from the wall). I was instructed not to use it until they could get someone out the next day to fix it. Next day came (Thursday), more workers in and I got the all clear that a gas leak in the line had been fixed and we were good to go. We ordered pizza that night because I was too tired from unpacking to cook. Friday was the inspectors day to stop by and check everything out. And what to you know... the farking stove exploded again. Bigger this time. With blue flame and smoke and the whole nine yards. More panic from the inexperienced homeowners."

"If and when recidivism studies are conducted, to the extent unemployment is a major risk factor for recidivism, it's possible vocational programming may be as or more effective than drug treatment at reducing future crime: Right now we just don't have the data to tell. But since the two most important risk factors preventing reentry success are difficulty finding employment and drug use, to the extent vocational ed helps overcome the first of those barriers, it's likely reducing recidivism even if the studies haven't been done yet to calculate how much."

"It was spring again. William leaned on the balustrade of his terrace and looked out at the Pacific. Frangipani bloomed in stone urns on either side of him. Fifty yards ahead, and almost at William's level, a seagull floated in the air. William watched it fold its wings and swoop down toward the village dump. Then his attention was attracted to a dusty black car that had emerged from the village and started up the road toward the villa. A plume of dust rose behind the car. Presently William could hear the engine laboring. The car disappeared behind a clump of pines, reappeared in the road directly below the terrace, and came to a stop. The driver got out and ran around to open the rear door, and Mrs. Twett emerged."

Getting the plan off the paper it’s written on into the actions needed to make it a reality is one of the most difficult things to do, yet funny enough, the simplest! What you do is act.

It very frequently makes amendments or alterations. It appears, therefore, to be more consistent with the Dignity of the Queen, that even if Her Majesty approve of the Treaty as it stands, Her Ratification should not be given, until it is certain that the President has been authorised by the Senate to give the Ratification of the United States.”"

He just lay on his back tossing his head back and forth and whimpering softly. He had no energy to drink so every two hours I had to coax him to take some milk from the bottle and then slowly pour more into his mouth bit by bit."

"As I try to sum up 6 weeks of God’s glory into one letter, so many emotions and thoughts fill my mind and my heart. I wish I could bring Cambodia back with me. However (that being impossible), I hope to bring what I have learned back with me to share with others. My time there was so sweet and it was great to see all the work God is doing among the people of Cambodia! I went with a team of 7 other Americans (all in their 20s) from all over the United States. We met at training a week before departure, and spent that week together getting to know each other and getting to know God’s heart even more. We started off as complete strangers but 6 weeks later, saying our good-byes in the airport, it felt like we were saying good-bye to family. Each of these wonderful people has such a heart for God and a heart of servitude. It was amazing to see how each of them was seeking after God on their own, and together as a group."

"Titanic was a ship of supremacy; the classes of human race were divided according to the money they made. No third class passengers were allowed to be on the deck where the first class passengers were lodging. Even the staircase, which led to the first class decks where guarded to ensure no third class passengers sneaks in to satisfy their curiosity. This was the ultimate rule, no two cross cultures were to mingle and this was solely based on the preference of the high society."

"Needless to say, I was so wrapped up in the evening’s events that I forgot to take any detailed tasting notes, but the 12 Year Old immediately took me back to our Bowmore tasting on the coast back in January (this has some more in-depth tasting notes). Smooth and with incredibly well-balanced flavours, the 12 Year Old contrasted with the richness of the evening, with its savoury wood notes and a hint of peat on the finish. The 15 Year Old (Darkest) was much sweeter and heavier, with hints of raisins, almond and darker wood notes."

I wanted to steer clear of the modern, Abrahamic, Western religion in these posts and instead focus on traditional, ancient, forgotten religions as my focus was historical. After reading more, I personally think the bringing in of children into this matter is a very modern phenomenon."

However, reading takes some getting use to. I find it oddly hard to hold and I keep accidently clicking the next-page buttons. I’m frustrated by not being able to easily flip back to reread or flip forward to see the length of a story. I’m also constantly babying it: cleaning its screen, wrapping it up, keeping it away from water, etc, etc."

"I knelt and broke down in front of the beautiful image of love which was the witness of many of our promises and words of honor. Offering her the fragrant bunch I whispered to her in a trembling voice, “My love has found her morning and is in your arms. The time has long gone when I could repay her for what she gave to me. I offer you my gift of love that was meant for her, I bring to you those flowers that remained as buds while she waited for them to bloom.”"

I have also recently discovered Pinterest (yes, I know I’m a bit behind), which is serving me well as far as a procrastination station goes. And there’s only one week left of classes! The graduates are frantically pulling together their Keystone projects and presentations, which I look forward to seeing next week. All ending with commencement!"
"The unsurprising announcement that the Board of the World Bank had voted in favor of the American candidate, Jim Yong Kim, presents an opportune moment to reflect upon the soft power structures that shape global public policy in the early 21st Century inside the UN system and beyond. It is necessary to draw a distinction between Mr. Kim’s substantive qualifications and the procedure by which he was selected. Substantively, although lacking in either financial or diplomatic experience, Dr. Kim is in certain respects an interesting choice because of his lifelong dedication to improving the health of the very poor in the global South, as well as his training in medicine and PhD in anthropology. He has had extensive relevant experience on the ground, and in working with NGOs (he co-founded the widely admired Partners in Health) and in institutional settings (for some years he directed the HIV/AIDs program for the World Health Organization) and has been president of Dartmouth University for the past three years, although stirring controversy during his brief period of administrative tenure. It may be still wondered whether Dr. Kim understands sufficiently the economic dimensions of World Bank policy to enjoy the respect of the professional staff, and might have been more appropriately chosen to head an enhanced program of the Bank devoted to health and poverty. Overall, still, the substantive case for the appointment is relatively strong, although the two opposing candidates, both former finance ministers of developing countries, certainly had equally impressive substantive résumés and ethical profiles, and were plausible choices for this position."

"We got into the examination room and she did great looking through all the various devices and doing what she was told. Then came time for the eye drops. I had attempted to prepare the staff about Katie. When I called to make the appointment I had told them that she has autism and that she does not like having her face/head messed with. I TOLD them that putting in the eye drops to dilate her eyes was going to be an issue. “Oh don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” Well, you haven’t dealt with MY kid. When we arrived at the appointment, I reminded them, “My daughter has autism and she doesn’t like having her face messed with. The eye drops are going to be a problem.” Again, “Oh, don’t worry, we deal with children all the time.” *sigh* When it came time for the eye drops, I told the assistant, “Katie has autism. She does not like having her face messed with. This is going to be a challenge.” “Oh, it will be fine. I work with kids all the time.” What happened next was straight out of a time passed where they tortured patients at hospitals… They laid her back in the chair and I could see her beginning to panic. Then, the assistant came to stand over her and tried talking to her. The hands came up to the face and the yelling/crying began. Katie is a very vocal and verbal child. She is FULLY capable of relating to those around her how much she dislikes a situation, and she did just that. I stood back and watched in absolute horror/vindication. I tried to tell them! I mostly stood by to see the man struggle with the situation, but I finally took pity on him and I went over to help by holding her hands down. I told her over and over again, “Let the man do his job. You need to have these eye drops to make sure your eyes are healthy.” All the while getting louder and louder. She was also getting louder and louder. I can only imagine what the people in the other exam rooms were thinking. Now, since her hands were pinned down, she scrunched her eyes up. The poor man (kid really) tried to get the drops in. He had us go out to the waiting room while the drops did their stuff. Poor Katie was all red from crying and she was all sweaty from the stress the whole situation had caused her. But, she was happy to be done with it all and enjoyed looking at all the glasses. After about twenty minutes, the man (kid) came back to check her eyes… We had to try the drops again. The first go round didn’t take. *FUCK*"

"I wanted to concentrate on all the good things I have in my life - the wonderful friends and family, the great places I have been and also the simple pleasures of my life. And I couldn't go past mentioning my beautiful husband Kevin. Most of you probably know that Kev and I met after he responded to an ad I placed in the Connections section of the local Sunday paper. That was 17 years ago this April. He was one of over 200 respondents and he was my 17th date (I am nothing if not persistent!). I first met him when he came to my place for a coffee - not the wisest thing to do, but my brother Adam was lurking in the background. He knocked on the door and Adam welcomed him and handed him a beer. Kev said later that he was desperately hoping he was at the right house (grin). We chatted for a few hours and I headed off to a nursing night shift. After that it was just one of those things. We kept ringing each other and catching up and six months later we were living together. He was nothing like the man I imagine I would spend my life with, but at the same time he was everything I needed. He was (and is) calm, kind and genuine. There is no pretence. He says what he means and doesn't tend to sugarcoat things. Most of all he loved me for all my faults and foibles - he never (and has never) asked me to change and he wanted the same things from life that I did (and still does)."

My mother lost my father when she was 27, and she taught both my brother and I that we should know how to do certain things for ourselves. I know how to change my own tire. My brother was admonished with ""No woman ever shot her husband while he was washing dishes."" But my mother was disappointed that I didn't enjoy many of the foods that she did. (If ground beef, chicken breasts, and cream of mushroom soup were made illegal tomorrow, she'd have a difficult time making tomorrow night's dinner, put it like that.) She was also highly critical whenever I did attempt to help--I could never stir fast enough or slice thinly enough.

"After three years of searching, and now 21 years old, I still had not found what I was looking for. I heard about a course called Silva Mind Control, which was invented by Jose Silva. I took a friend along with me and we signed up for the course. I had no idea what I was getting into, but the flyer that I had looked at promised me that I would have the ability to diagnose and heal those who were sick. We were told to lie down on the floor and visualize a workroom. Then we were told to create imaginary counselors to help us in this workroom. My counselors were Jesus, Curly, of the Three Stooges, and the Lone Ranger. LOL! I figured that each of them could be trusted. Much to my amazement they would appear with me in my imaginary workroom. We have discussed some of what this is in the pages of this book.

"I wish I could say that the Zan-Gah stories are completely accurate, but my approach was not primarily archaeological; it was humanistic. Zan-Gah is about courage, brotherhood, and compassion, among other things. Were prehistoric people compassionate? I doubt it. Nevertheless, I tried to be accurate where it counted. I researched slings and hand fishing. I researched prehistoric twins, discovering that in some early societies twins were terribly frightening and killed immediately—and so was the mother (not the father). That information was important in the development of my plot. I had never actually been inside a cave, so I visited Onondaga, one of the world's great caves (my state of Missouri is famous for them), and was overwhelmed by the experience.

"A Dominar in the Skorne Empire who rose to power through politicking and corruption, Rasheth is atypical of the Skorne as a people. The Skorne generally follow strict codes throughout their lives, almost all of which center around self-denial and drawing strength from pain. Rasheth, though, is not a fan of any of that malarkey, and lives to indulge himself. Having taken control of his house through shady deals and well-timed assassinations, Rasheth is in a position of great power in the Empire. His house has the best and most effective titan breeding methods in the entirety of Skorne society. This has allowed Rasheth to grow fat and rich. So much so that he can no longer move under his own power, and is carried everywhere by a team of agonisers. The only thing that has stopped any of the other Skorne Tyrants and Dominars from moving against him is his effortless mastery of the Skorne magic of mortitheurgy. No other Skorne even comes close to rivaling his control of the arcane, and so he is safe, and free to grow as hedonistic and as wealthy as he can."

Their wedding is set, as is Geeta’s to Dr Ravi but of course the path of true love never runs that smoothly and there is still the confusion between the two sisters to sort out. Although Raka tries to save the day, in the end it’s Geeta with a little help from her sister who proves that anything a Bollywood hero can do, a heroine can do even better.

"Only acceptance can be asked of you, for what you are is certain. It is set forever in the holy Mind of God, and in your own. It is so far beyond all doubt and question that to ask what it must be is all the proof you need to show that you believe the contradiction that you know not what you cannot fail to know. Is this a question, or a statement which denies itself in statement? Let us not allow our holy minds to occupy themselves with senseless musings such as this."

And in South Africa the PRAAG representatives undertook to contact the foreign correspondents of Swedish newspapers and keep them updated of events.

"The secret to the success of both movies, of course, is that they aren't really ""Arabian"" at all. What they are, in fact, is Arabesque -- an elaborate fantasia on the mere idea of the tales of Scheherezade, decorated with the filigree of genies, evil wizards, fabulous monsters, dauntless heroes and pure, chaste maidens in mortal peril."

"About 4 and 1/2 years ago, Marty and I were living in San Diego, CA. We were stationed there, while Marty served in the US Navy. My Dad was living with us, at the time. I got sick. Not just a little sick, like wretchedly ill, I just want God to take me NOW, kind of sick. I thought, I had a stomach virus, but a couple of days in and no one else in the house was sick. I had a fever, headache, chills, stomach ""issues,"" etc. I literally laid on the couch for days (thank God my Dad was with us to take care of Eli and Julie). I was officially out of commission. There was a long series of events that led to me being seen at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. We had to fight with the insurance to get me in, because I was supposed to be seen by a civilian doctor, but couldn't get in anywhere. Turns out I had a severe case of pneumonia. Doctor's wanted to hospitalize me. I said, ""No, just give me something strong and send me home."" I had suffered at home for days, anyways. Went home got better, life moved on."

It tells you everything you need to know about the Palestinians that they are the oldest existing “refugee” group in the world! Israel has done what any sane nation would do. It built a huge wall to keep them penned up in Gaza, controls the West Bank, and maintains a strong defense on their northern borders with Lebanon and Syria."

"But this is an image I am willing to be stuck with. In fact, I’d much rather you think of me as the mean mama than for you to think that my child is crazy or insane! Which is why I’m OK with you thinking I am mean for not giving him a piece of cake the size of a baseball, or as many candies as he can manage to eat throughout the time at the party. I’d rather you think I’m mean now than have you thinking he’s crazy later because he’s literally bouncing off the walls and being one of the rudest, most impertinent little children you’ve ever seen. I’d rather you think I’m a mean mama because I don’t allow my little girl to run around the room full of people “harmlessly” playing tag with another little girl. Better to think me a mean mama than for you to think she’s insane as she literally looks drunk and crazy and then can’t stop herself and could even end up hurting another child later. Better to think me a mean mama…"

Daddy and I have decided to start several traditions to honor you at Christmas each year. We let Caleb and Joel pick something from World Vision to use your Christmas money toward. This year Joel chose to buy 5 ducks for a family, and Caleb chose to help orphans. Your brothers talk about you often -- every day -- and ask about Heaven a lot. They both miss you terribly and looks forward to seeing you again one day. As a family we are also giving money to a missionary couple in Indai who work with slum children and to Samaritan's Purse Children's Heart Project which raises money to fly a child and 1 parent to the U.S. for life-saving heart surgery.
On to Monday morning at the OB's office. Still feeling fine and only minimal spotting (all of this was only when I wiped) no aches, pains, cramping etc. They took us in and said ... okay, everything looks great! We'll get the doppler out, find a heart beat and go from there."" Cold, and nervous they squirted the jelly on my belly and began. With my eyes closed and hand clenched around Charles' I prayed and prayed ""Lord, give us a heart beat, a strong, strong heart beat. Put our minds and hearts at ease and get us out of here!"" Well, the midwife said... ""yeahhh probably that uterus"" no worries, we'll getcha an ultrasound!"" She had us wait in the waiting room where I began crying... remember, we had prayed for a heartbeat. We wanted God to show us that first thing so we would have our minds at ease... ultrasound was next, and almost last resort."

"We are studying the American Revolution in my classroom. I wanted to show my students how the colonist felt over paying taxes to a distant king, so I staged a reenactment. First, I gave all the students some M&Ms in a cup. Then I appointed a student to be king and two to be tax collectors. I told all the students wearing red to raise their hand and asked the ""king"" if he wanted to collect taxes, M&Ms, from the students wearing red or not wearing red. The fun really began when the ""king"" made up more new taxes. He imposed a Girl Tax, Glasses Tax, Sibling Tax, and so on until their cups were almost empty. I will admit it got rather noisy with all the protests from the tax payers. The students were outraged! This set the stage for a lesson on the real taxes imposed on the colonist."
"I really wish I had brought my camera to school on my birthday. My darling (and very sneaky) 6th graders found out it was my birthday, and they threw me my first ever surprise party! They all hid under their desks after we came back from lunch, and they jumped out and yelled ""SURPRISE!"" They even brought cake and presents!! My favorite part was the sweetest handmade card they presented to me after the party. It started out as just one folded piece of paper, but more kids wanted to sign it so they stapled more paper onto the back. The notes my students wrote me almost made me cry! They were all so sweet."

Tammy got a phone call a few months ago from a company calling themselves Yellow Pages saying that they had a refund for us. Before she could ask any questions they informed her that I had signed up for advertising services (we're sitting on a domain name for a possible side business when we're retired) from them but that I was canceling the remainder of the services and that they needed to know where to send the $500. They asked her a series of questions and recorded her answers before transfering her to another telemarketer who began to explain the contract she'd just entered into. Say what? Tammy made it clear to them that she didn't sign up for anything and called them on the scam they were engaged in.

The set includes a variety of oval-shaped frames, and let me tell you, they make putting together a card such a snap! To make this card, I printed the frame on white cardstock, then layered it on to a piece of the hot pink cardstock. I then added a hot pink oval to the center, where I stamped the greeting in Versafine black ink. The patterned papers are from my scraps stash. I used one of my border punches by Fiskars to liven up just the corners of the polka dotted paper. In keeping with the challenge, I added a little floral and ribbon embellishment, with a pearl-topped hat pin tucked into the center of the ribbon behind the flowers."

The above policies need to be adapted with great insight to the specific circumstances of this country. In particular it is necessary to consider the dual nature of the South African economy and to match consumption patterns to local production capacity. This consideration supports the first of the above New Economics principle and runs counter to the 'neo-liberal' wisdom of the globalisation process.

"I remember a time when I was pretty small that she made corsages of violets. She would drive out on the rural roads and pick the violets. Then she would bring them home and bunch them and dip them in a preserving wax and pretty them up with bows. Then she would drive the long distance to a well-known ballroom dancing hall and there, on the street outside, would sell the tiny bouquets to the gentlemen for their ladies. (She did not know it then, but many years later she would be one of those ladies.)"
"Well, unless he’s Bernie Madoff, he’s not being picked on in any meaningful way at all, except that the President has (rightly) noted that the peculiar incentives of Wall Street, combined with a lack of regulation and, um, morality (my word) led to the collapse of the global financial system, and lots of people had to bail Wall Street out. Kinsley’s friend may not have caused the crisis, but neither did I, and yet Republicans in this country seem to be saying that the only people who SHOULDN’T have to chip in to knock down the deficits that came out of that collapse, two wars that were bought on credit, a Medicare benefit that was charged as well, and tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the top tier of earners in this country is…that same top tier."

"McCormack’s understanding of Barth accounts for the objections that Van Til and subsequent evangelicals propounded regarding Barth’s account of scripture. McCormack answers Van Til’s allegation that Barth “espouses a subjectivism in which human faith is the condition of the Bible’s becoming the word of God.” While not resolving all tensions for evangelicals that are committed to a classical account of metaphysics and the historical Anglo-American account of Enlightenment epistemology, it creates space for dialogue between evangelicals that have divided over Barth’s proposals."

"Put Aristotle’s and Steiner’s logic to work, though, and you have a far more useful tool. Take the status quo, and then imagine an opposite that’s just as bad as the status quo, but for the opposite reasons. That makes you think about just what it is about the status quo that’s problematic, to begin with; once you’ve identified the problems, it challenges you to consider the downside of going to the opposite extremes; and once you’ve identified the spectrum of possibilities, it leads you to explore many points along that spectrum, in search of the range of options that offer the most benefits and the fewest drawbacks. It’s far less simple—or simplistic—than going to the opposite extreme; it also works better in the real world, where hard binary oppositions are a good deal less common than muddily complex issues in which moderation is inevitably a better strategy than extremism."
It’s been said that we notice faults in others that we are most guilty of because we are more aware of them. I guess this is a form of confession because I find myself in the passive voice many times when I write and then I must go back and rewrite. How much easier it would be if we made ourselves aware the passive voice and wrote the first draft in the active voice. It would certainly save a lot of time.

"There has tended to arise the idea, from Leninism, and more particularly Luxemburgism, that the creation of Trades Unions is a symbol of the fact that the working class is a revolutionary class, whose conditions of life spontaneously generates a class consciousness, and that it is this class consciousness and the automatically arising collective and solidaristic organisation, which is the basis and form through which the new forms of property under Socialism are established. But, a reading of the programme set out here shows that conception is false."

When a customer comes into a strip club, the first place he usually stops at (besides the ATM machine right outside the club) is the bar. It's a transition for the customer. He is mentally adapting from the outside world to the inside of his carnal desires. The bar gives the customer a chance to take a breath, relax and form some sort of game plan in his head before venturing out to the floor filled with plastic shoes, glitter and g-strings."

Do you sit there, declaring what’s bullshit and what’s not? Do you call the man on his shenanigans? Or do you sit back and allow the insanity to take hold, to seep through your every pore and infect you with the oddity of pure sense. Not an ounce of this picture is coherent and yet you never question. Once the claws are in, you let it drag you along, smacking your head against the sidewalks of ‘irrationality’ and ‘Oedipal complexes’.

There was a woman who made it possible for me to find the place where my soul fully lives, if only for a week a year. She saved me many, many times and she never even knew it. She helped me understand what it was like to live completely and fully, if only for a little bit at a time. I am 'in place' there."

"You were given a side, to Ipasa (Pass) or Ibagsak (Fail) the President’s first year as the commander-in-chief of a country struggling to accept the reality of its extreme social, political, and cultural poverty. The debate, wherein arguments are presented, raised in the form of contentions, supported by credible and reliable facts, opinionated with an understanding that emulates critical thinking; a debate WE were expecting that DID NOT occur."

"These are their tactics of gaining support through lying and making members of their community believe them through the propaganda they so actively spread. This is starting to sound more and more like a certain violent doctrine I know of. It’s very easy for us to gather our members in each division around the country and attack members of any community. We are part of a grass-roots movement so large and strong, anything is within our capabilities. There is nothing out there that can match our strength. But we chose not to go down this route. The police are not at our demonstrations to protect us. They are there to make sure no harm comes to our counter protesters. But one promise I can make is that if any of our members are attacked like this again, we will act."

"Yes, I was still playing with my Silhouette too, so made my framework for Tabia on this creating a 'special place' for Tabia to reside within the bubble circle all of which I had also made myself. This circle of circles is in fact two layers so that I could add the coloured 'bubbles' neatly. These ones were actually made from colouring Promarkers onto acetate. The reverse is actually ever so slightly different (a couple of extra cut out bubbles so it is just that little bit more interesting on the back than it otherwise might have been - I know, I am mad!!!) The logic being of course, that as it dangles it will rotate slightly so didn't want it to be too boring on the back."

"However, in my opinion, the film's real star was Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault. His role is like the other roles, only more so. A self-proclaimed corrupt official, Rains' Louis sparks scenes with his sly wit. He could have been a villain but in Rains' hands, you can't help but love him."
"Next is the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. I read the books and listened to the radio plays and loved them both but for different reason. I’ve chosen these books for their sheer delight in the English language, general silliness and its cast of crazy characters."

Sure there are lots of ramifications. If you send the illegals home, it will have an impact of prices. If you don't send them home, you basically saying - It's OK to exploit them as cheap labor. If your saying make them all citizens, I'd ask who the hell is going to pay for it? And if you say - the government I'm going to smack you upside the head with a 2x4.

"Some people are lucky enough to end up in a satisfying and rewarding job that they really enjoy but for others wage labour is a grind; a daily misery that has to be endured. For such people the prospect of self employment has the appeal of making you ""your own boss"" and offering some (albeit limited and largely illusionary) freedom. But going into business, which is what becoming self employed involves, comes at a price. Hard decisions will have to be made regarding ones relationships with other members of society and it's not easy to be an entrepreneur and a nice guy. Another alternative is to get enough money together to buy your way into the landlord class, and the same tough decisions will have to be made. Of course not all business types and landlords are complete scum. Indeed many do their best to follow their chosen path in life and at the same try to give everyone a fair crack of the whip; there is after all such a thing as a good landlord. Clearly not in that category are the greedy, heartless swine who have decided to make a fast buck by evicting tenents in order to re-let the property (at hugely inflated rents) to Olympic tourists."
"And on top of the fear and the hurt, I’m just plain pissed off. Like I want VERY BAD THINGS to happen to him. Which is horrible of me and the second I start thinking that way, the second I am reprimanding myself for being such a bad person to think like that. I want more to happen to him than just being without a vehicle or a phone. Because, seriously, if he would just get and keep a freaking J.O.B. he could make that happen for himself. No. I want him to suffer. I want him to feel heartbreak. I want him to be lifted to the top of the world and then thrown into the ground. I want Karma to come kick his scrawny little ass for EVERYTHING he ever put me through, up to and including this latest fiasco. A lot of me has faith that this will happen because that’s just the way things go with me. A very dear friend of mine says it’s because I have a REALLY strong energy force. I don’t know about that, but I DO know that people who hurt me get hurt. Bad. And 9 times out of 10 they end up regretting doing me wrong. And you know what? I FORGIVE them. I do. Not because they got theirs and we’re even, but because over time I recognize they are human and make mistakes. But THIS? I don’t see myself forgiving him for a VERY LONG TIME."

"To kick off the campaign, the parents organized a time for me to come and talk to Countryside Elementary Kid’s Council in the morning. After this, scripts were written for each school for morning announcements to spread the word within all of the schools. We also designed posters for each school to put up in the main entrance of their school. The announcements to remind students to “turn of lights behind you” are made every morning during the week. Along with this, each elementary student got a Tolby light switch decal and kid-centered action guide. Woofta! With all this great work we were able to bring students attention to the simple energy saving action of: Turn off lights behind you."

The game is slated to be kicked off at noon CT. The Saints will then have their bye in week 11.

And yet, the author herself came from such a background, earning a bachelor's degree from Harvard and an MFA in fiction at Columbia. Although the book is clearly semi-autobiographical, I almost wish the author had written it as a memoir so I had a better sense of where the line between fiction and reality lies in this work. But sometimes truth is even a stranger tale than fiction."

"Otaku are a curious lot. The domestic, Japanese brand of zealousness is legendary, truly something marvelous and/or frightening to behold, as fervent devotion to favored idols, seiyuu, anime/manga characters, bands and other celebrities goes far beyond mere “fanaticism,” which is perhaps the closest Western analogue, although not nearly the same level of intensity. When scandal breaks, the otaku community erupts and the colossal outpouring of visceral response -be it bitterness; resentment; jealousy; or other form of discontent- can spread like a metastasizing, virulent contagion and the effects can linger long after things have technically “blown over.” They can be militantly hostile in defending an icon/franchise and are very outspoken if they feel industry professionals are not living up to perceived standards (Just ask Anno Hideaki)."

"That was my most shocking comet until 2007. That’s when Comet Holmes suddenly burst on the scene – and I mean burst. One night it was an incredibly dim magnitude 17 object visible only to professional astronomers and amateurs with extremely large telescopes – and neither the professionals nor the amateurs were much interested in it. Such faint comets are fairly common, and this one had been seen on repeated visits since 1892. But in just a few nights it was easily seen with the naked eye. Amateur star gazers were dazzled. It was a bright, round cloud in the same general area of the sky as Hartley 2 will travel through this fall. Yet it was farther away – out beyond the orbit of Mars and oriented so that from Earth we were looking right down the barrel, so to speak. That is, it had a tail, but the tail of a comet always points away from the Sun and in this case it was pointing directly away from us."

Meanwhile, black folks make up just 8.1% of Austin's population, but a whopping 28.1% of petty marijuana cases. Latinos are the only one of the three largest ethnic categories who are arrested and cited for marijuana at roughly their proportion in the general population. Whether the disparity is driven by race or whether race is a proxy for other factors - like police deployment decisions - I cannot say. But I don't understand why the number of marijuana cases should be rising, and I certainly don't understand why black folks would be targeted so much more frequently for enforcement. Don't kid yourself. There are a LOT of white pot smokers in this town."

"Just as much as it is about the family though, it is also the story of a country that is fading away. When Charlotte and Wilhelm return from Mexico to Berlin in 1952 to take up their responsibility of building up the new country, the dream of a uniquely German socialist state is still a heady one, an intoxicating vision of an ideal future. As the years progress though, we see the reality of East-German communism, the plastic cars, the crumbling buildings, the power shortages... While stalwarts like Wilhelm continue to believe in the system, others feel that the country has lost its way, some (like Alexander) hoping to leave it behind for good.

"One of the least known aspects of the GE Bt brinjal is its ability to cross with wild relatives or cultivated varieties. This is because there are no recent reviews in the scientific literature concerning species related to brinjal, and where they grow across Asia. This information is vital when addressing concerns regarding cultivation of GE Bt brinjal, because insect-resistance gives a selective advantage to the plant, increasing its ability to survive and reproduce. If the GE Bt brinjal cross-pollinates wild, weedy or cultivated relatives, the result is a hybrid offspring, which may grow more aggressively and thus become a problem weed, the report says."

"Director of Technical Quality, GRS Group Bill Tryon is Technical Director for Global Realty Services Group, where he is responsible for due diligence standards for environmental, property condition and seismic due diligence as well as construction monitoring. During his thirty years in the industry, Bill has developed risk management policies and procedures for one of the world’s real estate lenders and has participated with governmental agencies to refine policies and requirements. Bill first became involved in environmental due diligence in 1988, before the creation of current industry standards. As Chief of Construction and Environmental Services for a major real estate lender, he developed independent standards for the completion an evaluation of environmental assessment activities. In the mid-90’s he became a founding member of the Environmental Bankers Association. As committee chair for various committees, he worked to assure an in-depth understanding of environmental issues across the membership. More recently, he has consulted with the Small Business Administration and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding environmental policies, participated in the Environmental Protection Agency’s development of standards governing “all appropriate inquiry” and presented various topics at EPA Brownfield and other industry forums. During his involvement with the early development of due diligence standards to support early CMBS lending programs, Bill worked to refine broad industry standards to produce scopes of work more specific to lending risks, resulting in price reductions of nearly 40%. Additional cost reductions were realized by implementation of a “small loan” assessment. Bill’s ability to cut the fat away from standardized industry products helped control risks while reducing costs and creating a competitive advantage. In 1989, after California’s Loma Prieta earthquake, Bill became involved in the evaluation of earthquake risks associated with owned properties as well as the loan portfolio of a major real estate lender. Since no standardized approach to the evaluation of such portfolios existed at that time, he was forced to become familiar with the principles of earthquake risk assessment in order to develop appropriate corporate policies. As the market expanded, he extended his approach to portfolio analysis to include the evaluation of CMBS loans. It quickly became apparent that the industry and even many of the consultants involved in the analysis earthquake risks had a limited understanding of the variables which can significantly impact the conclusions of such studies. Bill adopted and defended criteria appropriate to a portfolio-level evaluation of risks which was eventually validated by ASTM International standards published in 2007."

"I had been healthier just before I caught the infection that put me back into acute mode than I had been in a long time. I went to a fund-raiser supper at the church for the first time in years, literally, and I did it without the wheelchair or the oxygen. So people saw I was alive and still wanting to be part of the church community. Maybe that is why I got cards, phone calls, prayers, meals, etc., but probably not. It didn’t surprise me how much it all meant to me. I hope I have been able to convey that in my thank you notes. And I hope to be encouraged enough by these acts of love to move toward keeping community a part of my life. After all, the church mission statement is: “Love God, Love Others, Serve the World.” And one of my favorite scriptures is Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord,”plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”"

I’ve taken a liking to placing the infusion set in my upper arm. I like the different location and it causes no problem in cooler weather, but is slightly more problematic in warmer weather. Without sleeves, the site is often the victim of door frames, driver seats, sports bras, and stares. Yep- people stare. Some ask questions, opening a dialogue for some good old fashioned education. Or smart-ass responses."

"The above ""Trail Print dress"" has a lining that is cut very narrow through the hips, making the appearance of the outside seem blousier and more forgiving than it is in actuality on the body. This is a cotton dress so it is versatile for all seasons and easy to launder at home (still I only hand wash, line dry). Solid color versions are made of a substantial silk blend fabric and come unlined, without the same hip issues of the cotton version. Printed versions of this dress require sizing up for ample hips or dealing with spanx. The above is an 8 but I tried the 10 and it fit similarly with slightly more hip room in the lining."

There are some. Like–I have discovered my inner neatnik. I didn’t even know I had an inner neatnik. Compared to Mom, I still don’t. But let’s just say I’m acting a whole lot more domestic than I used to. All that was more or less to be expected, though. It’s going fine. But let’s be honest. They’re still adjustments.

(NIV)As parents, one of our values should continually be to get our kids to behave a certain way when we are not forcing them to do so. Our goal is that they would make wise decisions when we're nowhere around. Anybody can drive safe with a cop in the rearview mirror. It's on the open road that is the concern. Yes, I know your kid's an angel at their friends house and a pain in the rear at yours. I get it. I just mean that ownership, not compliance is our goal. If it isn't, I guarantee that compliance or fear won't work as a dating motivator. What will make a difference however is shared values.

"A propane grill or charcoal grill for cooking food when you no longer have power. This is great and makes the most sense because grills are portable. If you loose your home you could take your grill (assuming you have a portable one). I recently bought a grill. I’ve always had one because I love to BBQ, nothing taste better than food cooked on the grill. I choose a propane weber grill and kept my small charcoal grill. I did this for two reason 1. I may not always be able to afford propane. I keep two large fuel tanks, and many smaller propane tanks. While these are good for now and will get me through a year + without power. There may come a time when I can no longer afford propane. If that is the case then I have my portable charcoal grill. 2. I’ve stocked up on charcoal. During the great depression many people would go to railroad tracks looking for pieces of left over charcoal. Luckily, for me there are still train tracks where I live that transfer coal."

"We had a fairly quiet day on Sunday so I jumped straight into making some of Leigh's recipes. I don't have a lot of experience with pastry making although I do love eating it. Ready made puff pastry sheets are usually my preferred option for when the pastry cravings hit. I started with lemon and passionfruit tarts which used a sweet shortcrust pastry. The pastry was a breeze to put together although rolling it out after the resting period took me a while. The lemony filling required little effort and as I don't own any tart cases, I made mini tarts using a muffin tray to make the cases. They were really lovely with a wonderful tangy flavour from the lemons, just my type of sweet."

"During sleep, our brain releases inhibiting substances to prevent us from acting out our dreams fully, although we may toss, turn and even talk in our sleep. The feline brain works similarly. In laboratory experiments where unfortunate feline subjects have had their brains tampered with so that those substances aren’t released, the cats act out their dreams in full. Even laboratory-bred cats which have never hunted, or even seen prey, have been observed to ‘catch birds’, ‘chase mice’ and ‘bat prey’ in the course of their dreams."

"The book begins, like Well-Met in Kith’takharos, with a colour map of the region, an explanation of how and why the authors design adventures, and an outline of the scenario, which has 10 events or encounters. There are three different adventure hooks to draw in the players, depending on whether they played through the earlier scenario or are fresh into the village."

"Yesterday was much hotter than we have had in the past week. 97 degrees and muggy. When it is muggy and hot in my state, every business owner turns their AC down to 32 degrees. This is not fun for me. Anytime I go into a building I become a Popsicle. I literally freeze, so for me the hotter it is outside the more layers I put on in order to counteract the inside temps. It is easy for me to remove a top shirt or vest while in the car and pop it back on when I head into a store or business."
"Another communication problem: there's a hospital chain that is our main account. We are all set up to sign in and chart at all the hospitals in that chain. A couple of months ago, word came down-- 2nd, 3rd and fourth-hand-- of a new way to chart the dialysis treatments. It was, we were told, mandatory. Here's the problem: five different people told me five different ways to do this mandatory way of charting."

"The two beautiful hot dogs above are from Wayne's Chicago Red Hots, recently-ish opened on MLK here in Portland. Those dogs are the real thing: Vienna Beef hot dogs with the full complement of authentic Chicago goodies including pickle, tomato, onion, weird green relish, mustard and celery salt, all on the correct poppyseed bun. After several failed attempts to get a certain stepdaughter to bring Vienna Beef dogs back from Chicago, I've finally found a place to eat them."

"Recently I’ve asked a couple of you to remove spoilers from your reviews, and you kindly and graciously agreed, and for that, I thank you. Others of you refused to change a word, saying you stand by what you said. I did not ask you to change your opinion. I merely asked you to remove the spoilers, which did not merit the abusive reply."
"While many are familiar with the stories of uprisings led by Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey and John Brown, a significantly fewer number of people know the story of revolutionaries Charles Deslondes, Harry Kenner, Kook and Quamana who led a group of enslaved Africans toward a vulnerable New Orleans during the annual Mardi Gras celebration in hopes of gaining their freedom. That is about to change."

"Yes and no. Our bodies are just as much a part of who we are as are our souls. When we worship, we involve our bodies. The sacraments have physical components (water, oil, laying on of hands, etc.). Furthermore, there are instances where the body acts directly upon the will. At some point, an addict might no longer have any choice in the matter – he can no longer help himself. Some have suggested that this is what St. Paul was getting at in Romans 7:17: “As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.”"

"I didn’t get any sort of epiphany from solanin. Instead it was more of an affinity — I didn’t just relate to these characters, I WAS these characters, trapped, confused, unsure of how to move forward. The best thing solanin did for me was point out that I wasn’t alone, that I wasn’t actually failing just because I didn’t know where my life was supposed to go from here. It also reminded me that even when your lost, you can’t just stand still: after Taneda’s death, Meiko ends her months of wallowing by picking up his guitar and deciding to join his old band. Music isn’t her dream, not like it was for Taneda, but it becomes something for her to do, to focus on. She finds a long sought-after connection, and even if it’s not necessarily moving forward, it’s still moving, which is better than sitting round letting the toxins collect. It may have filled me with an undefinable feeling (friends I lent it to didn’t fare much better, returning the book with an uncomfortable look on their faces) but I’m glad I read this manga at the time I did."

"This is the topic that originally prompted me to expound on some general ideas about how Biblical literalism tends to go, and some of the problems with it. I’m not going to bring any pesky “evidence” or inconvenient “facts” into things here.

"While going through a large bag which contained her make up, a roach came out to say HI to me. I squealed, picked the bag up with 2 fingers, ran it through the house, and threw it out the front door. Oh HELL NO! My husband wants to know what I am going to say to her about the make up bag being outside. My first thought is 'If there was a roach in my bag I wouldn't want any of that shit.' So I said ""I'll tell ya what, when she pays me back the hundred or so dollars for the air mattress they ruined, I will replace her make-up."""

Elaine and Axel F narrowed it down to Frozen Peppermint Bouche de Noel and this one. Upon presenting these two final options to mom and dad I received the response: 'the whiskey one. When we see whiskey, we react.' The whiskey one it was."
"Seven conspirators line the streets, all in different locations, yesterday preparing to assassinate the Archduke. He was set towards city hall, and as the royal car approached Gabrinovic, he threw a bomb that bounced off of the car and exploded near the following car. The Archduke and his wife continued on to City Hall, and retraced their previous path after the ceremonies were over. This put them in the range of Princip. Amazingly the car stopped directly in front of him and he fired the two deadly shots."

"This is moving along fairly quickly. It helps that I love the yarn (Frog Tree Pediboo), and that most of the rows are stockinette, so I can read while I'm knitting (which I did this last weekend; Nook finally has my favorite Bujold books available, so I got a couple, along with Reich's latest ebook release, which I highly recommend, if anyone is looking for something that will make them think, and perhaps foam at the mouth, in a good sort of way). It's not a difficult or mind-consuming knit, but a fun one. I'm done with the striping, so now it's only the gray border to go. And I have a two-hour Senate meeting this afternoon, which should translate to some progress."

I love this polish in the bottle but on me it just doesn't work :("
"Also, the other part of the article, where the kids had to come home with permission slips to watch ""How to Train your Dragon"" but not for receiving the bible....ridiculous. There should have been permission slips sent home for the bible or any other religious materials that would be handed out. Has anyone noticed how violent the bible is? Or the things it teaches us that we are suppose to be doing...some areas in Leviticus (sheesh!)...should we not punish children then when they throw stones at each other on the playground? There is a reason children are not given grave details on the Civil War at such a young age in school....what is the difference?"
"Das Racists’ first two mixtapes, released in 2010, were perfect summer records. It was actually the summer of ’11 that found my circle of friends soundtracking warm, aimless nights with “Rainbow in the Dark” or “Hahaha, jk” and the group’s ironically-ironic careless attitude already feels nostalgic in the way that summer records do after just a few months. Now in the winter of 2012, we have the first solo mixtapes from Das Racists’ core MCs. Heems (Himanchu) has filled his first outing independent of the group, Nehru Jackets, with a lot more to discuss than his counterpart, though I may get around to a review of The Palm-Wine Drinkard eventually."

"But where did we begin? 3 1/2 years ago we bought our 1971-flat-roofed-brick-house on a wing and a prayer. We weren't the highest bidders, but I wrote a letter to the owners explaining why we wanted the house and what it would mean to our family (I hinted at our family challenges early last year when I started the Blue Velvet Chair blog if you want to have a peek). It worked, and they chose us. We knew the entire house was due a proper renovation and a chance for a new life - it had a super solid foundation to work with - fabulous space both inside and out. Let's have a look at what it was like when we moved in."

"During the semester, I am busy with students and other various runnings around in my life. I don’t get to print that often. I have three blocks (2 lino, 1 wood) ready for printing. I have recently discovered Akua inks. Good bye oil based, smelly, messy clean up inks! Hello eco friendly, water cleaning up velvety finished ink! I highly recommend this ink to anyone who prints for monoprints/monotypes and relief/intaglio. Since I have three blocks ready, I am gonna print the first color for all of them today since all need yellow. I used Akua Intaglio in Diarylide Yellow. It is a wonderful warm yellow, borderline a golden rod yellow shade."

"The surgery is now finished, and Sam is headed to the CICU for recovery. The Glenn portion of the surgery is over and looks pretty good; however, there is one tiny snafu...the vegetation next to his tricuspid valve has gone missing! Where is it? Nobody knows! If it left the heart, that means it went somewhere else in the body; possibilities include the extremities, the gastrointestinal tract, the lungs, or the brain. The brain would be the worst-case scenario. There is some concern that it went there because the oxygen saturation levels on the right side of his head were somewhat low. Now (of course!) that may mean nothing--lots of possible causes."
"Almost all of the rise in nonmarital births has occurred among couples living together.

"With a balanced throat chakra we “… tune into our own inner voice; it picks up our intuition and our spirit guides and angels.” This helps us tell the difference between our “ego” thoughts and our true messages and beliefs that come from within. Pg 143 Our intuition is not “an audible voice” but a subtle message. To increase your intuitive powers you will first need to be open to being an intuitive person. The second decision is to expect to be intuitive. “Expectation acts as a magnet for intuitive feelings.” 145/146. The third decision is to trust the feelings that you are opening to “because your intuitive feelings may not be supported by appearances or confirmed by others.” Pg 146 The fourth decision is “…to act on your intuition when it guides you.” “Making these four basic decisions – to be open, to expect, to trust, and to act on intuitive feelings, will create a direct conduit for your fifth chakra to communicate messages to you…” pg 146"
"Last week I spent five days in Nashville working on my first record with my producer, Marshall Altman. The first three days we were in pre-production. We recorded scratch tracks for 11 original songs (with the exception of Be My Vision which is a contemporary version of the Hymn with a brand new chorus). The process was detailed, trying and really fun. I had to fight for things I really believed in and learn where to let go. It’s probably a good exercise in life too, right? Good therapy."
"Water resources in the Middle East are subject to an unprecedented pressure which is threatening the populations of entire regions along with their economic activities. Population growth, migration, urbanization, and climate change are all exerting an enormous impact on these resources. In fact, over the last 50 years, the flow rate of numerous rivers in turkey, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan has plunged by 50 to 90 percent. And yet at the same time, the sustainable management of trans-border water resources is vital to provide for the requirements of agriculture, the need for clean drinking water, and for socio-economic development in general. It is key to avoiding human tragedy and to fostering the promotion of peace."
"God waited patiently for the right time for Christ to be born to bring about the new and perfect worship system where men and women will worship in “truth” and in “Spirit”. Even the apostle Peter struggled with these concepts even after he had first hand witness of what Jesus had said: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.(Joh 2:19)”."

"I've been working at SAINTS for almost three weeks and i am enjoying it, i find myself eager to get there and see everyone and get the work started."
"Nowadays, people shack up all the time. They are in no way distinguishable from a married couple, except by their lack of a license. (I would say they lack the lifetime commitment, but so do the married people, too, much of the time.) I say, why can't they have a lifetime commitment without the license while they're at it? Why can't they go by their local church, synagogue, or hippie guru and proclaim their lifetime commitment? Why in the world is it against the law for them to do this? Maybe they don't want the state to bother with them. What about that scenario is so terrible?"
"Later that night, Emmy Lou is getting undressed, knowing deep inside that Jonah Hex is alive. There is a knock on the door. It's the hotel manager with a message.

"When I woke, I could hear one of my guides telling me quite loudly to go for a walk. I’ve learned through experience to trust my guides and go with whatever they’re telling me because they’re always right. I splashed some cold water on my face, changed into some clothes and grabbed a quick cup of coffee to take along on my walk. I was staying at Marga Country Park, home of a magnificent estate built around 1870 and just below the estate were the ruins of an old Abby. The estate or castle, whichever you prefer to call it, was from the neo-gothic time period surrounded by lush gardens and the beautiful rolling hills of Wales. In the distance, nestled high on a hillside, you could see the ruins of a monastery. Now being a bit of nature person, I thought to myself what a wonderful place to go for a stroll and maybe, just maybe, a brilliant idea would come to me for my speech."

Out of those submissions, I have not accepted one."
I want to write a little something about what happened to me last week and how mark. helped fix it!
"This is something I’ve debated on and off with quite a few children’s authors. Some take a hard line and resist saying anything that could be construed as boasting. Others feel that Facebook, say, is there for the sharing of good news however big-headed it makes one look. One author I talked to this week resists social networking altogether, because she’s so careful of her public statements."

"Sometimes the way I learned growing up seems surreal to me, when I compare it to how most others spent their childhood. Like I lived in a different world, despite my physical proximity to everyone else. Sometimes (often), I still feel that way! It's such a radically different way of living than that of the mainstream that it's hard to reconcile the two. And I find myself frequently just really, really not getting why anyone thinks the traditional way of teaching small children is a good thing! Learning can be so simple, so flowing, and so much fun, if only parents and educators would relax, sit back, be ready to help if wanted, but mainly just let it happen. Children are remarkably good at learning! As the great John Holt said:"

"Vera Farmiga’s Higher Ground. I was so impressed and touched by this film about a woman’s life as a Christian that I’m still vexed I didn’t take the time to write about it extensively. Farmiga isn’t a showy director, letting instead the story take center stage. She stars as Corinne, a young woman whose faith grows stronger as she and her husband build their family and become part of a hippie-ish community of strong Christians during the 1970s and 80s, including the earthy Annika (Dagmara Dominczyk, below) with whom Corinne has a rich and happy friendship. For many of these years, her faith gives her a deep sense of self and identity."

"The Fling surpassed my expectations. I WAS expecting the felt work in my Scandinavian Rug class to be physically grueling. It was. (I am glad I did some training by making two natural fleece rugs on my own; plus all my gardening!) What I was not expecting was how easy everything else was and just how wonderful it would be to spend a week with people who all spoke felt. I also wasn't expecting to learn so much outside of class, though I should have been. I find fiber artists to be so much more willing to share and support than groups of artists in other mediums. For example, after the show and tell for Erma Yost's class I spoke with her about using some of my old woodcut blocks for printing on fabric. I have been wanting to try this for a long time, and Erma gave me many tips and showed me which paints she like to use. So through the wonderful rug class with Rod and Karoliina, visiting the other studios, show and tell nights, and conversations with so many other feltmakers I learned so much and I am filled with ideas of things I want to try."

Dramatic guest spots included both The Dick Powell Show and The June Allyson Show. She also had a failed TV pilot for a sitcom called “The Jane Powell Show”. Powell was also a regular guest on TV variety shows in Australia when she visited there to perform her nightclub act. She also had a one-off TV special in that country in 1964."

My boy acts less interested, but is a total sponge with knowledge. i'm sometimes surprised by the amount of information he retains when i don' even realize he is listening. He can often tell me the name of wildflowers that i've forgotten. :)"
"The need to know and the ability to predict what others are thinking to do or will do or how nature behaves is essential part of human scientific spiritual growth from the time we discovered Fire. For example we want to know whether rains come or not next year. This helps farmers to decide to either sow or not to sow. The rain pattern helps governments to prepare for draught management. Oppositions parties to blame governments. Again if rains come we want to know will there be heavy rains so that flood management can be activated. We want to know if there will be medium rains and limited water availability then planning can be done for alternate crop patterns. We also want to know if there will be very little rains so draught crops can be sown and water conservation can be activated. If there are super heavy rains like cyclones we want to know at least 2 days before so that all population can be evacuated to safe areas. The entire meteorology departments were existing for this function of predicting cyclones using again mathematical modeling of temperatures, wind gusts moisture etc."
"You see ever since we came to the UK just after our marriage, a little less than three years ago, we have been planning to travel. It was one of the juiciest carrots my husband dangled to bring me to the UK. He showed me dreams of seeing Europe, not in 15 days but slowly, steadily, a little at a time. Needless to say I fell for it, hook, line and sinker. The first year when he was a full time student and me, sporadically employed, travel was an unthinkable luxury. Second year we were finding our feet, settling in the hectic life of London fresh from the green pastures and slow life of Oxford. But by third year we were ready to travel.

There is just something so spiritual about being in the midst of nature. It seems easier to tap into that when you're right in the middle of it. I sometimes have to remind myself that all that wonder exists when I am stuck inside scrubbing a floor or doing the dishes. Yet, I know that I can find the spiritual side in those simple things too. It's just that I have to remind myself to do so a bit more."

"Like when I asked God for the miracle of weight loss and he gave that to me. I was told by many that I lost weight because of my work and willpower not because of God. They deny the power of God and give me the credit for something I was not capable of doing. The second I got arrogant and gave myself the credit I gained 100 pounds back. I did not have the ability to lose the weight, nor did I know what I was doing when I sowed the grass seed. I lost the weight and got the grass plus tree blooms because God blessed me with what I asked for. I asked God for signs to show me if what I read a few weeks ago was the truth. I got the signs. It was not just a random weather phenomena like many will claim. I got the signs and that is the power of God.

"Becky’s Mind: Bombarding – this word makes me think of doing the dishes. Every time I wash one plate, three more appear in the sink. It never ends and I feel like I’ll never leave the sink. That’s when I start making silly agreements in my mind. I agree that my family doesn’t deserve me. They don’t respect and understand me. They take advantage of me. They don’t really love me so I agree to not really love them back. Suddenly, I’m on one side of the wall and they’re on the other. That’s how Satan works in my life – just a few dirty plates at a time. He doesn’t come in and ransack the kitchen, no, that would be too obvious. He lets me get the last dish put away, then he brings me two more. I get those put away, and he shows up with three others. I handle those three, and he comes at me with one more. Satan slips one or two doubts at a time in there until before I know it, I’m putting up walls to keep God out as I make agreements with the enemy: God doesn’t respect me, He doesn’t deserve me. Wow. Who am I, the Point of Grace song goes, that He would love me gently, that He would recognize my name? I am His and He wants to help me tear down those walls so that He can walk with me! “…Walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.” Galatians 5:16-17."

"Jane believed she could find and refine those virtues in Mr. Rochester. I believed the same thing about my husband. Doesn’t that break the old rule, though? “Don’t choose a man thinking you’re going to change him?” Maybe a bit. But it comes down to what the man actually wants. Mr. Rochester wanted to be a good man. My husband wanted to be a good man. And the Rake always gets what he wants."
"Selfish glee: observing so many pages I had never seen. Evidence: pages I made for someone else. The Stories: priceless bonus (and favorite part of the book that never would have happened). To witness journal love by the many readers? An awesome added benefit. Being part of something that encourages artistic growth, including my own? That rocks."

"However, I’ve noticed that Paganism generally seems to have become a very insular spirituality. While folk do seek others of like mind to meet up and chat, in pubs or at Camps, generally their practise is kept private, at home or in quiet places outside, alone. This may be due to fear of ridicule, actual need for secrecy because of misunderstanding, or just a preference for a solitary mode of worship; I’ve no problem with that at all. Ultimately, any conversation that you have with deity is just the two of you."
Patience truly is a virtue. (Especially when there are only two service elevators for a building with 48 floors.)
"Then there is the fact that I left a job I loved, working for a wonderful Montessori school, to start my own in home preschool. I've been given the impression that some people in my community (who sniff out drama) think there is MORE to this story than there really is. That, since I'm being completely open here, is fricking exhausting! Look: People resign from their places of employment and start somewhere new every day. There is no big dramatic story to tell.

"During the meal, we chatted and at one point I asked Mark how he could be a Christian and yet much of his tour schedule consisted of playing at rowdy bars. Mark made reference to the Gospel passages that tell how Jesus went to be among the publicans and the sinners. He said that he wanted to minister to the people that really needed it and not so much to play in churches. His mission was to save lost souls. He knew that he still had a large fan base from the Grand Funk days and many of those fans frequented bars. If he was there with them, he might have the opportunity to minister to them. This sounded like a good answer to me."

"Our focus verse for the Say It With Scripture Challenge at the Sweet 'n Sassy Connection is 2 Corinthians 5:17, ""Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new."" Last week we talked about how our music should change once we've accepted Christ as Saviour. This verse tells us that the changes should not stop with just our music. Old things are to pass away and ALL things are become new. This means those old attitudes, actions, vocabulary and ways of thinking need to change. Depending on the person, it may require a change of wardrobe, viewing habits and how we interact with others. WHY do we need to change? Because we are a NEW creature in Christ. We are not the same as we used to be and we now wear the name of Christ. People should be able to see a difference in our lives; we should not look, act, sound or react like an unbeliever. This week, let's each take a look an inward look and ask the Lord to show us areas where we're allowing the world to creep back into our lives. Then, let's ask the Lord to help us make the changes necessary to make sure ""old things are passed away."""

"Having said that, I won’t rule out that sitting stationary at our family dining table in the front room and staring at my laptop for many hours of the day has something to do with feeling sluggish and tired. Admittedly it has often been the lack of any vibrant movement that has got me a bit irritated at times. But alas, when one needs their laptop for almost EVERYthing (as most people do nowadays): sending emails; monitoring projects; reading articles & journal entries; typing up documents etc…not to mention the fact that I haven’t seen or socialised with any of my friends for 8 days now (which is actually a long time when you usually live with your best friends), it’s pretty much a given that one would feel a tendency to get frustrated. However, this holiday, and other recent ones like it, I’ve been taking conscious steps to still remain a normal functioning human being, and not a robot from being cooped up in exile; studying, reading and writing."

"This drama is hilarious. I really had a great time watching it RAW and never did it waver when I finally watched it with subs. Lee Seung Gi is such a.. what’s the right term? Vainglorious? He’s played an arrogant-jerk in Shining Inheritance as a Chaebol. Then as an irresponsible, action-star-wannabe in MGIAG. Now, I feel like its a combination of all the characters he’s played and it fits him to a T. The teasers for this show kinda threw me off.. because I never thought of seeing Seung Gi to be so serious. I mean, military? Then again, drama surprised me since they didn’t really strip off Seung Gi of what I’ve known him to be and what I’ve grown to love about him."
"‘Like Crazy’ is a quiet movie. What you hear is low-key dialogue, as opposed to loud explosions and cars crashing. Unfortunately, the quiet tone of the film was interrupted by the loud eating of the couple to my left. These people were eating their pop corn with remarkable vengeance. It was as if the pop corn had inflicted major pain upon them and it was revenge-time. They were attacking the paper bag like it was the last available food on earth. And do you know what happens when you attack a paper bag? It makes a loud noise. And do you know what happens when you are munching pop corn? Yes, that’s right, you are very loud and the person to your right is wishing you would choke on it."
"Lip Service: And it's back. Like Sherlock, BBC3 decided that waiting nearly a year and a half for the second series of the Scottish drama was a great idea. On the plus side, this was a solid opening episode. I'm not keen on the Frankie/Cat/Sam triangle and I still don't like Jay as a character but overall, the episode was good. Tess's love life with the football fan Finn and her new co-stars (including bitchy Nora) are amusing and Lexy seems like she's going to be a good addition to the series, so welcome back ladies."
"2)SLAPPING CLARK GABLE. perhaps not good. I don't know. A compulsion. Can one exhume the girl? Completely? I wonder if I will write the girl continually, like hag-Duras in The Lover, and conjure her up, and conjure me up, will I ever feel at rest or at peace. Or perhaps: I will always be a girl, which is to be always in flux, the reclaiming of D&G's becoming-woman that uses all masculine archetypes. This was the subject, partially, of the Facebook discourse earlier today. Anyway: on: feminism and sex. On messy feminisms. On girlhood, which is being messy, and desire, which is always messy. The first piece for n+1 (if I can manage) due Labor Day - memoir+criticism+reportage? - on: Lena Dunham's Girls, and maybe Francesca Woodman, and maybe M.C., and maybe a subject of boundaries. But I think lately watching Girls using a good pal's HBO Go subscription, that I'm interested/obsessed with ideas of authenticity and this experience, and is that the search, authenticity. Versus what - a melodrama? Isn't being a girl melodramatic? Or: the other side of fakery: commodification. Am I making sense here? Also, as Kate Durbin said today on Facebook, horror is the perfect genre to consider the girl. Yes:and perhaps my issue with GIRLS: the TV show: it is sitcom when it also reads so queasy horror. I don't know. The second essay of this for Frequencies, due early fall? on Acker and the archive at Duke, but really: about how Acker subverts and complicates the idea of the Kunstlerroman, which maybe also segues with Lena Dunham's Girls, and MAYBE I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME WRITE ANYTHING DISCREETLY OR DISCRETELY. I don't know. Also: writing of Lispector, maybe. Thinking today of Macabea as a queasy, grotesque, girl in the woods. Mostly film + TV I think. The psychosis of ABC Family, Last Tango in Paris, Deneuve in Repulsion, idk. Tumblr. Gone with the Wind, obviously."

I wasn’t really expecting to learn as much an insight and moral from an action-packed movie – especially a superhero movie – such as The Avengers. Maybe I wasn’t into critiquing the plot of a movie or maybe I was boxed with the idea that movies do not necessarily reflect reality. But I sure did pick up lessons after I’ve seen the film.

"I read somewhere an argument that speaks to me on this: film studios have no real problem with ‘test screening’ a movie for audiences across the nation. The director of the movie doesn’t just drop some film reels off on some producer’s desk and walk away. There’s constant tweaking, even after it’s been called “done”. What are “director’s cut” editions, if not either the movie as the director originally envisioned it or tweaks to the film after it was shown to audiences? Book authors are a different matter, but they still have editors looking out to make sure the book is as cohesive as they can make it. Heck, even published works can get a brand-spanking new epilogue after the book’s been out for a while. So why is it that this video game, which has much more flexibility in terms of last-minute tweaks, is suddenly supposed to be set in stone? Nobody calls the test audience for movies “whiny entitled brats” if they didn’t like the ending. It means somebody misjudged the audience, and if it’s a serious enough misjudgement (is that even a word?) then the studios fix it. So even these other “works of art” are fixable right up to and beyond the point of publication/screening/distribution."

They were so kind and helpful and willing to answer questions...the residents and attending that I was with completely and totally made my month on psych a fantastic experience, and I could not be more thankful for that. I had one other student with me full time during the rotation and that only served to make the experience even better.

"For the second card I took another nestie label and this time fixed it with a little masking tape on the inside of the card and dry embossed with a ball tool on both the cutting edge and the inner embossing edge. If you've not tried this before, it's a nice easy technique - easier with a lightbox (but I didn't have time to dig mine out so it is possible without one). Secure the die inside with the cutting edge facing the outside of the card, turn it over and rub gently with a bone folder - this creates a soft line on top of the cutting edge so you know where to put your ball tool to begin. The trick is to go over the lines a couple of times to get the depth (I use a double ended tool and start with a thicker end then use a narrow one for definition once the fibres have stretched) - if you go too hard and deep too fast, you just rip the card stock. You can do the same thing on an embossing machine but I think you get a deeper impression by hand."

"Many of my favourite actors to work with have been my fellow theatre cast mates from theatre productions I’ve done over the years. But in film and TV, I have been fortunate, too, and some of my favs are Hilary Swank – she’s incredibly focused. Our scenes were so intense. I learned so much from working with her on ‘The Reaping’. I loved working with Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard on the FX TV series ’The Riches’. They are both such lovely spirited people, and were so devoted to that project. But my favourite star so far would have to be Brooke Shields, with whom I just finished working on ‘The Hot Flashes’. She is so sweet and down-to-earth, and really such a talented actor. She’s at the top of my Fav List right now, for sure."

She had told him about a sibling group of six children, ages 8 months to 13 years. He then told me that really she had only asked if we were available for four of those children, as they had found someone who would take the oldest and youngest already. They were Hispanic, and were currently split up in three different homes. Wow. That was a lot to take in. We spent an hour in prayer and talking about it before calling our worker back. The interesting thing was that my hubby’s devotions that day just happened to be the story of Moses, and how he was rescued from certain doom by someone not his mother; what amazing things did God do with him?!? What if God wanted to use us just as He used Pharaoh’s daughter, to step in and parent some children that He wanted to do great things with? We called our worker and asked her if we could just come by her office and meet with her."

It didn’t matter what sort of comment she wrote in the margin; it could have been a punctuation change. Whatever it was made me see red. Stubbornly, instead of learning from what she, the experienced professional, was flagging in my work, I dug in my heels and snottily thrust my nose in the air.

They were gonna be late. I helped the guys get ready and out the door, then cooked dinner for the remaining Harty's at home :)"

Who is looking out for the older sibling’s welfare? Who is going to nurture and love them? Make sure they are educated? Potty train them? Get them dressed and off to school? Do they even go to school?
"I guess the main thing that’s been bothering me all day is the war, the Middle East. It’s such a complicated subject. We’re supposed to be out of there, but there are still so many contractors getting away with having people in there and continuing to commit atrocities. When is it ever going to stop? Why do people join the army? Would there be such high entrance into the army if higher education was free?"
"“Oh, Him.” He was deliberating which chip to impale upon his fork; now really wasn’t the time for isagogics or theosophy. It was hard enough simply spelling them, let alone doing them, not that there was anything simple about spelling them. “Well, let’s see: his full name is Ubiquitous Eternity God, he’s a sixty-two year old unemployed song-writer living in California in a single room in The Brazil Hotel (it sounds grander than it really is), he’s got a fondness for Budweisers, massage parlours and walking out in front of oncoming traffic and stopping it with a wave of his hand while he crosses the road.”"
"I would further ask this sheikh: What are Muslims supposed to do when they see their rulers become servants for Israel and tools for their own enemies as well as thieves plundering billions of dollars from their people's coffers? Are they supposed to just sit down on their comfortable sofas and watch tyrants violate people's dignity, usurp people's rights and ruin the people's wealth, pending the arrival of the Day of Reckoning?"
"It was shortly after their ten year anniversary that Michael saw his opportunity. His wife brought him a screwdriver, asking if he'd hang a picture in their bedroom. He took the tool and examined it closely. It was when his wife asked why he was looking at it that his mind crossed that barrier that separates what we want to do and what we do, and he killed her with the screw driver, and then proceeded to hang the picture that she'd asked him to."
"But assume I didn’t live in the forest any more, but in China. Some kind of fortune or misfortune has brought me there. Let’s assume that. Now that would be terribly unpleasant. For in China, as is well known, everyone is Chinese, even the emperor. I would stand out. My name is Hase, and I look like a German. One would be able to recognize me immediately. Why, even the children would stand stock still in the street and call out “That’s Hase.”"

"I met Jacob, another American and the only other person staying at the hotel the afternoon I arrived. We hung out the next few days. It was great to have someone to see the sites with. The churches are split into two groups, North and South. It costs about $25 to see them, and if you want a guide, it's another $20! Such high prices in such a poor country, with very few people seeing that money. I went with Jacob and his guide to see the Southern churches- which was nice, because when I walked around the Northern churches alone, I had no idea which church I was looking at."

"What's the purpose behind S&S's new policy? I'm guessing that S&S is gambling that electronic rights will become hugely valuable at some point in the future. Right now they aren't, and I don't believe that anyone, even the most vigorous prognosticators, knows how or in what ways they may become so. But with its rights grab, S&S is hedging its bets, retaining control of books it may be able to exploit in new ways as times change and new technology becomes available. In this situation, authors are double losers--first, because they lose control of their rights forever, and second, because if S&S does exploit the rights at some future point, it will be doing so under old contracts. As the development of the ebook market has made clear, new technologies demand new terms and new negotiations."

"As for Jerome, he did mention reasons for skepticism of 2 Peter, and he only lists stylistic reasons which he explained as being due to Peter’s usage of different scribes.[56] History knows of 3 scribes for Peter: Silvanus (1 Peter 5:12), Mark (recorded by Eusebius)[57] and Glaucias (recorded by Clement).[58] It is more than likely that Jerome’s understanding of literary difference due to different scribes is reasonable. It’s perfectly reasonable to suggest that 2 Peter records the writing style and vocabulary of Glaucias (or some unknown scribe)."
"Kipling’s Just So Stories: I used to be put to bed at 8:00 every night, without fail – regardless of the time of year. This annoyed me – especially in the summertime.

I remember one of the first books I enjoyed during this time was Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories. I was around 7 or 8."

Now I have them collected with some of my favorite colors and background techniques and all artful. And I can carry them with me! As I used a ring that I can open and close, I can also add to the ring when I’m working on a new affirmation or mantra…and I have extra circles cut so that when I want to play but don’t have anything particular artsy in mind, I can make more affirmation cards.

That’s racist towards white people, and not just society as a whole. Because everyone is racist on some level, why should whites be targeted any more than Asians or Africans? Being of a certain ethnic background doesn’t make you racist. It’s a human condition. The blog link doesn’t reflect that, so no, I’m not going to check it out."

"For a second opinion, I sent it to a close friend (who knows me all to well) to read, and give feedback. She loved it (Fear obliterated) but thought there might be some questionable parts (Fear confirmed)…for a moment I thought maybe it was a bad idea, putting myself out there exactly how I am, I was getting ready for a rewrite…when a text arrived from my friend. She said that she had reread it and thought that I shouldn’t change anything! There wasn’t anything questionable, she reevaluated, and she thought it was fabulous!

"Build smaller prisons. ... Large prisons become ""violentocracies"" -- places ruled by violence and by the threat of violence. In a violentocracy, the most violent people rise to the top. In any prison of any size, the prisoners are going to be pushed toward the level of the most violent persons in the facility. ... In a prison 3,000 people, the entire prison is pushed toward the level of violence created by the five most violent people in the joint. The most violent person finds the second-most violent person and the third-most violent person, and they form an alliance to exploit the weak. Everyone else is compelled to avoid looking weak. ... Large prisons promote paranoia in the prisoners. You never know who in here is waiting for you with a homemade knife. ... A prison of 20 people is, by its very nature, extremely different. You know who is in there with you; you know who you have to stay away from. ... Plus, if you have many small prisons, you can contain the violent people in a limited number of those prisons, the preventing their violent tendencies from infecting the rest of the prison population. ... What you would do, with a network of small prisons, would be to place each prisoner in a facility that is appropriate to the threat that he represents. You grade the prisoners on the threat of violence that they represent, one through ten. You put the tens with the tens and the ones with the ones. Plus, when you move to a system in which some prisoners have more rights and live in more humane conditions, you create a powerful incentive to get into one of the less restrictive prisons.. In a large and horrible prison, the new prisoner thinks ""I've got to show everybody here how tough and vicious I really am, so that nobody will mess with me."" But when you put a new prisoner in a 24-man prison with 23 other tought guys, and he knows that there are other prisons that are not like this, his natural thought is ""I've got to get out of here. I've got to show these people that I am not a crazy, vicious sociopath, so they will move me to some other facility that is not populated by crazy, vicious sociopaths."""

"It is much more difficult to see a propaganda system at work where the media are private and formal censorship is absent. This is especially true where the media actively compete, periodically attack and expose corporate and governmental malfeasance, and aggressively portray themselves as spokesmen for free speech and the general community interest. What is not evident (and remains undiscussed in the media) is the limited nature of such critiques, as well as the huge inequality in command of resources, and its effect both on access to a private media system and on its behavior and performance."

"In this heavily-anticipated sequel to 2012 Enigma, (#1 Most Viewed on Google, 12/1/08), David Wilcock presents a compelling case that the prophecies of a Golden Age are not myth or superstition. Our DNA has been evolving 100 times more rapidly in the last 5000 years due to a natural galactic process which is also creating climate change throughout our entire solar system. If the prophecies are correct, psychic abilities and powers such as telekinesis, levitation, spiritual healing and telepathy may soon become as common as breathing."

"It is always a truly peculiar situation. The tension residing in the interstices between the one and the other. The stark juxtaposition between percept and affect. The grinding in between. The antagonism we reference above is resultant of one being thrown amongst the detritus of society. Those forgotten. That’s how it begins. A violence that confronts the somnambulist as they are awakened from their complacent, passive, acceptance of the world about. The attempt to striate the miasma, to diffuse the smell, to relegate and delineate roles and responsibility, has created a zone of possibility where finally . . . finally, the representative becomes expressive. This I believe was the goal and intent of a Ms. Zoe Strauss. An utterance that could finally be discerned from the constructed milieu of an art world, of a home, of a people. One that resounded “don’t forget us”."

"I found it very interesting that they put information about the legends of dragons in China. Supposedly the dragon stands as a symbol for the great unity of the Chinese nation. It says some Chinese considered themselves as descendants of a dragon. The dragon was the symbol of the emperor, yet people used to worship the dragon because they believed it would bring the timely winds and rains for their crops. The dragon was seen as a symbol of harmony. Not a great deal of information, but certainly the little bit there was I found to be quite interesting. I like it when chart books come with little bits of information like this one did. The pattern book Ancient Egyptian Cross Stitch by Barbara Hammet had a lot of information about ancient Egypt to go along with the beautiful patterns that were in there."

"There are only two authors whose complete published works I’ve read: Samuel Beckett and Richard Brautigan. By ‘complete’ I mean of course those that are still generally available.

True happiness is impossible in this lifetime, we can only hope for a nicer afterlife.

"Last night, I caffeinated-up with the intention of cleaning for an hour, writing for an hour, then going to bed. Instead, I played on Facebook and a homeschool message board and wasn't a bit tired when Kyle headed to bed. The kids were in bed. The kitchen was quiet. No one was using the CD player. I had an audio book beckoning me. The time to clean out the craft supplies had come."

"And, lo and behold, Santa stopped by Tesoros one day at lunch and found the motherlode.

"This past weekend was my first Saturday in many weeks that I did not have to get up early for class. Although it was great to be able to sleep in and enjoy the feeling of being lazy on a Saturday morning, I felt as though I was missing something. Yes, I miss the fun and my new friends of my public speaking class."
In month 5 you buy another cloth diaper ($20) and decide to only get 1/2 case of disposables ($20) since you see a light at the end of the tunnel and don't think you'll need them for much longer. You are now down to using only 3 disposables a day.

"So, off to Jozi tomorrow and what with there only being 24hrs in the day and me being approximately 729 hours behind the Jozi Gym Schedule, I’m clearly going to be pushed for packing time tonight. Whilst I hear Jozi is doing its best Cape Town winter impression of just being generally shiyt in all aspects, I am also not surprised to hear that it’s fallen short of the Southern mark once more. Check out the SupeRugby log, boet."
"This is the third cake in a row last week, out of four (not counting the mini cakes). I almost officially feel like I want to take a break from baking for a week, but of course that'll never happen.

They moved the tent. My brother handed the ashes to the worker who stood in the hole. He placed the box inside a steel box in the ground. Then they asked if we had anything else to place in the box with her. We didn’t know we could do that. No one told us and I didn’t think to ask. I had never done this before. But nephew’s mom had the bouquet which she was pleased to put in the box. I put in a red rose as did my sister-in-law. That was it. We didn’t know what else to do.
"I want my thoughts to disappear but they won’t, and I won’t do anything to make them vanish. I remember when he said that “we both went into this relationship knowing it wouldn’t last forever.” That was at the beginning of it. In the middle, we did want it to last forever, but honestly, it never was going to last forever, and I never knew that I would have shared everything with him. I sincerely wish it could have been forever. I really wish it could have been longer, at least make happier memories. It’s really sad. I’m not ready to give back these things. I feel so, so light yet heavy. The necklace is off, and has been off and I miss it… I want it back on, but I won’t put it on."
"We have a lot of basil in our garden, somehow this year I've managed to grow more of it than I normally use (there seems to be forever a jar of pesto in the fridge!), which just means that I've become a bit more creative in how I use it, or (most of the time) just throw it into dishes more often. It added an extra dimension to a stir fry of thinly sliced kangaroo (marinated briefly in soy, sambal oelek and garlic), mushrooms, a red pepper from the garden and jasmine rice - its stronger aniseed notes went really well with the asian flavours in the wok. It was such a simple delicious dinner, I'm no longer bound by Italian cooking when thinking of how to use my basil! I have purple basil as well, but tend to use the green basil more often purely because I have more of it, it's thrived where the purple basil has been much more subdued (though its a very pretty addition to any garden!)."
It explained that it decided to take the action as a result of several incidents such as Ministers being barred from addressing Kgotla meetings.
"Most of the military build-up is concentrated against Abkhazia and South Ossetia. A modern, NATO-compatible barracks has just been built in Senaki in western Georgia not far from Abkhazia, and another one is under construction near Gori, a half-hour driving distance from Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia. According to the report, each of these bases will have the capacity to house a brigade, with a troop-strength of 3,000."
"Ahem. Back to the story: I was in second grade, and somehow my teacher convinced me to represent the class. I still remember the white dress my mom made me wear, with matching white tights and shoes (what was with the all-white ensemble?? *scratches head*). My dad coached and helped me practice at home. The song was...The Alphabet Song. It goes something like this:"

"Teachers have a different ‘knowledge’ than parental knowledge and it comes into play because unlike any other profession, teachers are given the PRIVILEGE of working with children and often times the parents don’t even know us by name. Teachers have to earn that trust day in and day out – with parents, but more importantly with students. The trust is so explicit that we are often told more than anyone else by students about their life and only when we have proof or a darn strong feeling that the ‘hypothetical’ discussion taking place is real can we report the issue to parents or social services. We can ask all manner of questions, suggest other people the student can talk to, services and phone numbers to contact but we are limited in giving opinions. By law we are mandated reporters and we stress to children that what they tell us falls into this category because we want them to know we care enough to do what is right, no matter what the outcome. Sometimes the most we can do is recommended to the school psychologist, the administrator, etc. that this child have an appointment. We can not even write our concerns in the cumulative file so we share them with another teacher(s) because each child is so precious to us and we don’t want something to happen."
"At the Vatican, Borgia’s called aside by della Rovere, who tells Borgia that, if he were a different man, della Rovere would vote for him. Borgia’s been a good vice chancellor, and the skills that made him good at that would serve the papacy well, but Borgia’s also lacking in honesty and other qualities della Rovere thinks are necessary in a pope, so he plans to fight Borgia to the end. Borgia calmly says he tends to win any battles he fights, but after all, this is in God’s hands."

"As this was of course, a rather special card, I decided to make it a coordinating box, so used the same pearlescent cardstock as the card base & part of the cross for the box's top & decorated it with another Spellbinders' cross as well as a lacy shape from the Lace Doily Accents set. The four tiny sections which had popped out of the die cut silver cross I used as embellishments & added them to the corners of the box lid. I then created an insert for the box (well, it isn't as if I didn't have enough to do is it, LOL), and this time used a sentiment from 'verses-for-cards'."

"Also, how do you have more money in your pocket? Work. You slug your way out, climb up the corporate ladder, do plenty of OTs, just to earn a few more bucks. By the time you get home, you’ll be too tired to have a proper bonding session with your children. Having kids and seeing them only a few hours each day and two full days is not going to help bond the kid with the parents."
"I also learned that I need to follow my very first instinct when it comes to picking music to listen to. If I get an inkling I might like to hear some particular song, I need to switch to that song AT THAT MOMENT, with a playlist by similar artists. It doesn't really matter whether they suit the mood of the writing, though up-tempo music is better than miserable stuff (of which I have a lot). The important thing is to be comfortable with my audio environment."

The evidence she relied on (which included a poem of mine which had been doctored to make it appear anti-Jewish) was not, he concluded, a fair portrayal of my views. In reality, I reject any and every form of racism, including antisemitism."

No need to color code my laying flock anymore, like we used to, so sticking with this breed in fine with me. I also can’t say enough about buying from a hatchery that has been in business for a long time. We used to get our chicks from a hatchery in Washington and when high feed prices drove them to retirement, we switched to this hatchery on the recommendation of a friend. The chicks are always in good shape when they arrive and do well here."

"Thanks for the Great blog. Something about myself. I have recently immigrated to a country were I had no job lined up or were I could not even speak the Language. To say that my first year was the most difficult time of my life would be a major understatement. I have now seemed to have crossed the largest hurdle, found a job and settled in. This is the sacrifice I had to make for my families freedom and survival. It saddens me however to read and hear about my beloved countries further decline into anarchy. I am therefore at a complete loss of words when the loved ones that remained behind have optimism for the future. What is this based on? Surely they are privy to the same information and news that I see and hear."

"'When your Daemon is in charge, do not try to think consciously. Drift, wait, and obey...' I knew this for the simple truth too. I concluded, from experience, that the Daemon always knows the detail and construction of a piece It has decided you will work on, but It cannot tell you directly. Or chooses not to tell. You are guided by images and feelings, steered along the path it wants you to follow by nudges and hints. When we are 'stuck' in a story, we have simply wandered from the path. If we stop trying to find it, if we try not to think consciously, but wait and let our thoughts drift – then the Daemon will guide us back to the path with more hints and nudges. When we struggle to find the way ourselves, we fall into mires and thorns, we get further and further from where we want to be, and the story 'goes dead under our hand'."

"Here, Kali refers to the personified kali-yuga. Pretention and fakery is his primary character trait. The cow-couple refers to the cow of Mother Earth and the bull of dharma.

The only leg that remains in Kali Yuga is truthfulness. The age itself pummels away at this leg so that it crumbles and is completely destroyed as the age progresses."

With 25 years of crafting under my belt, I've collected a lot of stuff (all good I tell ya, I might need it or I might go back to it).

"In the opening chapter, The Deity of Christ Today, Stephen J. Nichols bounces off the work of Stephen Prothero and argues that we have gone from a creedal Jesus, to a human Jesus that is close and ended up with a Jesus that has liberated itself from Christianity and the Bible (p. 27). Stephen points out that there have been many attempts within our American culture to present Jesus. Movies like The Passion of Christ, consumerism and our nifty slogans and even politics where Jesus is somehow on everyone’s side, show us that our cultural attempts to display Jesus have left us with “personal Jesuses who look far more like their makers than like the Jesus of sacred Scripture and the historical creeds (p.31).”"

"I have to say, it wasn't all that bad. He offered up his seat at the bar, like a true gentleman and flagged the bar tender over to take my drink order. Paid for my beverage. When our table was ready, he took out my seat and ordered a fantastic bottle of wine to go with dinner. The conversation was relaxed and easy, and then I made a joke. The laugh that came from the person sitting in front of me made me want to run for the high hills! I was not only loud, but had this quality of being high pitched, nasal'y and throat'y all at the same time. I was literally the kind of laugh that makes you cringe from the inside-out. I nervously chuckled, looked around the room to see that people's heads had actually turned and realized that this extreme laugh would take this guy down a long road of lonely unhappiness."

"Having made this acknowledgement, the logical next step is to delete this section. One cannot make this cut on the basis of promises of pie in the sky. Virtually everyone in Irish society, including myself, would love to see a Scandinavian model of child care being in place by the end of this year. I differ from some of those who claim it would not be possible, in that I believe it would be possible were there a real will and determination to make it happen. However, significant resources would be required. This defies credibility, given the fact that this idea is coming from a Government that is slashing, burning and cutting left, right and centre and is committed to considerable further budget cuts in the next two years under the EU-IMF austerity programme. If we pass the fiscal treaty, we will be required to make even more severe budget cuts in subsequent years. From where will the Government get the money and resources to put in place a Scandinavian child care model? The Minister and I would like to see such a model. Ireland did not put it in place when the Celtic tiger was in full swing, yet the Minister is telling the House that she will have it in place within six months at a time when austerity butchery is cutting everything. The Minister does not honestly believe it will be done."

"In the hard single bed, Kathleen’s feet sweat as she heard Claire stomping down the stairs to deliver her some Indian dish that she picked up every Wednesday from a trendy grocery store on her way home from work. It was too spicy for Kathleen’s palate and the meat was the same indistinguishable goop as the vegetables, but she ate it every week and pretended to be appreciative. She took a few bites to appease Claire, who was tittering about what she had for lunch that day at work. Claire looked all around the room, focusing her eyes on the bed skirt, the crooked throw rug, the smashed bug high in the left corner that no one had the heart to wipe away. Kathleen could tell that Claire had things that she wanted to say but couldn’t bring herself to. Every few days she’d bring up the cancer in felted tones but Kathleen would always stop the conversation before it got too far, before it made her scared."
"The square broke into deafening applause. Dust rose in the air as kids stomped on the ground in jubilation. Women ululated. Nibras's wife emerged through the cloud of dust and joined her husband and Mr. Think in the epicenter of the celebration, a huge grin of relief on her face."
"So the run went pretty well. Only went 4 miles, but still not bad for someone who hasn't done much physical activity in a while. It was quite tiring but oh well I guess I'll deal with it. The sun was pretty hot at 8 am. Didn't really expect that. I would have went swimming afterwards if the rain didn't come in. Stupid rain... I used to love the rain now I hate it, man, what is up with me?"

"As one of our three substitutes I decided to take the opportunity to ask him about his role. Sadly, he wasn't keen on conversation, which on reflection is probably an occupational hazard, what with the headset. For all I know he could have been in on a conference call with a host of delegates from FIFA's head office in Zurich. This is unlikely though. I would expect an organisation as spendthrift as FIFA to be more generous with the quality of employee trousers. By all accounts Sepp Blatter is a tolerant man, but badly pressed black trousers would not reflect well on FIFA. No, a far more plausible explanation was that his headset was plugged into a cassette player. The assessor would spend his evening listening to the recording in order to write his report on the referee's performance. Let it be said, the role of referee's assessor isn't all glamour."

"The problem that is the longest running and has given us the biggest headache is the problem of the other neighbour's barking dog. We seem to have written endless letters and e-mails to the Environmental Health Department of the local council together with the completion of many time sheets detailing when, how often and for how long the dog has been barking. At present the problem is still unresolved. After I posted A night on the tiles I had intended to write a post explaining some more of the background to the problem, but I did not do so, because we had a surprise intervention into the problem, on our behalf. Consequently I felt that it was wiser to keep quiet. The intervention came to nothing and I shall write the intended post shortly."

Especially not if a career means that everything hinges on how much power you have and how much money you earn (read: being a slave to someone and to money, always)."

"Doesn't that tell you something then, Pell? If you are claiming that the smoking ban reduced preterm births because it made people give up smoking, the fact that you found the same result with nonsmokers rather gives the game away, does it not? If, on the other hand, you're suggesting that reducing secondhand smoke miraculously reduces preterm births (I haven't read the study yet, but I wouldn't put it past you to indulge in such superstition), the findings for smokers strongly suggest that this is nonsense as well. Or perhaps you are going to claim that smokers somehow feel the benefit of secondhand smoke reductions as well. Nothing would surprise me at this stage."
"Having earlier said that I can understand not going too deep into the backstory, a critical element of the books is classism, leaving it out of the movie altogether, or only *barely* mentioning it, does the series an extreme disservice, as that's THE ENTIRE THEME OF THE BOOKS. (okay, maybe not the entire theme, but a main one) When you ""get"" that children are putting their names into the drawing for tributes more than once in order to possibly win food/wealth for their families, it brings that class/poverty/social-strati thing right to the forefront. The kids from well-off families aren't in there but once. Yes, it's mentioned in passing, but it's not explained."

"And now, the extremely funny news. Even those of us who do become indistinguishable from native speakers, including where native speakers themselves can’t tell the difference, fail to reach native proficiency: we have near-native-like proficiency instead (I’m not joking, seriously!). This is because we human beings, for all our native competence, are apparently fallible in our judgements about our languages. We don’t notice what we don’t care about, whereas the machines that we build to make our judgements for us do: the proof is in reported examples of millisecond differences in, for example, the amount of puffed air that emanates from native and non-native vocal tracts pronouncing the sounds at the beginning of English words like pan, tan and can (this is the “aspiration of voiceless plosives”, in the insider lingo)."

Mr Sevje also claimed that peace can only be achieved if the Israelis engage in direct talks with the terrorist organization Hamas:"

"But first, let me take you back to the summer of '91 when I was an LCA on the 727 panel at Pan Am. Things were not going well. We were selling routes. The BIG cherry just picked was the European operation (Frankfurt hub/A-310s) and the NY shuttle (LGA hub/727s) going to Delta. Delta wanted the crews they were prepared to take already trained in seat and type. So to accomodate the senior folk ALPA, the FEIA and management REBID the airline. Those who would have been saved from the inevitable collapse (like me) by going to Delta were now looking down both barrels at unemployment, furlough notice in hand and 90 days to figure out what to do. Yeah, my union was looking out for me again god bless 'em. So when I get called into the office and told in effect ""You will be training your replacements"" (the 747 F/Es who were bidding back to the 727 panel) I was at a loss for words. A thousand emotions flew across my mind."

"Yesterday was different. We visited the Morgan car factory - a 2-hour tour that anyone can take, but this was organised by TCAS as part of the 'Escape to the Hills' weekend. What always fascinates me when on such an outing is looking behind the scenes, the organisation, the attention to detail in so many aspects of a company. This post will not be a 'write-up' of Morgan - a British-owned, family-run firm since 1905, every beautiful car put together by hand, skilled workforce using hand-tools - just a gallery of the snapshots I was able to take as we walked from one dedicated workshop to another. I won't even caption the photos, for I cannot pretend to understand the technical aspects; hopefully such shots as I was able to take will speak for themselves. Words fail me for once - though I could research it if I needed to; most of the time I couldn't hear the tour guide anyway, for I lagged behind aiming for photos that showed the workmanship and not the backs of strangers!"

"Parenting, for me, has been like productivity boot camp and I’ve had to get pretty creative when my husband’s working late, the pasta’s boiling over, my daughter just cut her finger, my son is about dump paint on the floor, the phone rings, and the dog is begging to go out. Yes, parenthood can take over at times and prevent you from doing anything else. I find, though, that when I have time, I’m very aware of what I really want to spend my precious time on, which somehow allows me to access that creative energy faster. But hey, it’s just a theory. Maybe it’s just all that coffee I’ve been drinking."

"Of course every day here looks like a sunny day you’d find front and center in a postcard and the film is super full of the values that are adored by the conservative demographic that makes up a nice portion of Mr. Sparks’ target audience, while still providing the sexy scenes with the sexy actors to draw in the other demos. But it kind of works as that romance in Louisiana story; it’s just hurt quite a lot by the fact that the secret that Logan’s keeping just looms over the whole movie even if it’s not mentioned, especially because it’s not that big a deal when you dissect it had he just told it when he arrived there. But it’s when the film tries to go all heavy-handed dramatic with Beth’s ex that it’s just too bad to bear."

Coffee, tea and meat are just three of the dietary changes that people make as they begin to vibrate faster. Meat is especially dense and can really affect the body’s energy, especially if it has hormones in it. You may develop cravings for certain foods, or go off your favorite foods. This is normal and a part of the change to the higher vibration. If you find this happening, then let it happen and explore the new possibilities."
"Swigging a bit of Coors Light last night after seeing a six pack in the supermarket for £2. Not a national offer, I think they were shifting old stock. Which got me thinking that whenever I have necked this grog it’s usually an offer on old stock. Its never promoted in big cheap boxes. At least it was within its sell by date, though. I used to neck this grog regularly, but that stuff was all past its sell by date. So it was interesting to compare the bouquet and flavour of the beer pre and post date. Not a lot to compare really. It’s flavourless watery grog that slips down nicely. Light of flavour and light on calories according to the bottle. The lady squeeze likes this one and joined me for a bottle. She even managed a belch."

"Here's how this image came to be associated with a Boy Scout troop in Milwaukee (what a long strange trip it's been...) One of the kids belonging to Troop 11 took a vacation trip to south Texas and while there noticed and photographed a road sign with this image on it. He and several of his fellow Troop 11 Scouts decided this would make a great patch for their 'patrol'. (Here's a quickie Boy Scout primer for you: a troop is made up of 20-60 boys, and each troop is divided into individual 'patrols' of 5-9 kids. The kids in each 'patrol' name their own group and create a patch to signify themselves.)"

So I popped to Wilkinsons to get a fork and picked up a pack of PLASTIC forks, knives and spoons. I went to pay at the till and was told by the cashier that I had to be OVER 21 to buy these PLASTIC knives. I had to swap the packet for one that contained only forks despite the fact that plastic forks are actually much sharper than plastic knives!!"

The garlic is still fine to eat, and as that same farmer pointed out, we're not using mechanical planting machines and other industrial means to plant it, so our problems are compounded less.

"The last time I saw Taylor for the next 20 hours or so. A little blurry, but the last time I laid my eyes upon him this day. He wanted to walk ahead and I decided to get out my video camera and record some of the river scene, and see if I could go back and get the whio on film. There is a very distinct waterfall on the true left of the river not so far from where Taylor is above. From there it is less than 30 minutes to the hut, and a large orange marker indicates a track that cuts through the forks to the hut on the true right just before the forks. Taylor walked right by it."
"In 1969 Bukowski accepted an offer from Black Sparrow Press publisher John Martin and quit his day job (delivering mail for the USPS) to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, ‘I have one of two choices — stay in the post office and go crazy … or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.’ Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, ‘Post Office.’"
That actually explains a lot. It is wonderful to know that she feels safe and comfortable with me. Really! I just wish she would find another way to show me her trust.
"Shrove Tuesday is the day before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of Lent, for Catholics. Lent is the 40 days preceding Easter, which Catholics usually restrict guilty pleasures and try to eat simpler and leaner. So, since pancakes are made with sugar, fat, flour, eggs, which is traditionally restricted during lent; they have become to popular way to start off Lent. Since Lent is about giving up indulgences, I figured I'd give you all a pancake that would be worthy of Pancake Tuesday."
"As you can imagine, this turn of events left the U.S. in quite a pickle: In 1804, Americans were not yet willing to extend the revolutionary ideals of equality they had just established for themselves to their black slaves, and quite frankly, Haiti's ability to do so scared the pants off of them. It wasn't really a high point in American diplomatic history, and so the Haitian Revolution maybe has gotten dusted under the rug a bit in the history books. So this new exhibit is a welcome reprieve from that omission, putting the events in Haiti in their rightful place in the global narrative of that revolutionary period."

It was a wonderful experience and the girls loved it. Grandma Paula and I wished they had picked Pretty Princess or Diva Princess like Willow's Pretty Hair Piece but Piper and Harley both picked Rainbow Hair Pop Princess.

"Unwrap one pie crust and spread it out in the bottom of baking dish. Bake in 350 degree oven until it's golden brown. While the pie crust is baking, I peel and chop up vegetables. Put chicken stock in stock pot and heat up over medium-high heat. Once the stock is boiling, add vegetables to the pot and cook until they are tender. Mix 2 tablespoons of corn starch with 3 tablespoons of water in a separate bowl. Add the corn starch mixture to the chicken broth and cook over medium heat until the broth has thickened (about 5 minutes). Add one container of chicken to the stock pot. Let cook a few minutes then pour mixture into the crust and top with the other pie crust. Bake in 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown."

"The heat of the summer is more of an issue here, than winter cold. In the enclosed part, there are doors that open to screened windows to get cross ventilation. In July and August I keep an old sheet draped over the top to shield the coop from the brutal afternoon sun, since our back yard neighbor cut down their large oak tree. Sometimes I wet the sheet down to help them keep cool, when we hit triple digits. Ameracaunas are a good hot weather breed, as they are not very big and heavy. There are usually only a few nights in the winter when we have to rig up a heat lamp. This winter I think we only used it a total of 4 nights."

"I was out all day Saturday, with some of my plans for the day coming through and some not. I spent the morning and early afternoon at a huge art festival in Brooklyn. From there, I had planned on going to a smaller art exhibit also in Brooklyn, but the trains made it difficult. It was partly my fault; I probably could've left DUMBO a half-hour earlier (that's Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass to you non-New Yorkers), but I was enjoying the day too much. Still, I had to take a completely roundabout trip to Greenpoint because the trains that would've gotten me there quicker weren't running normally. I knew when I got off the train that I wouldn't have had any time for this show, so I reluctantly chose to blow it off and head to Jersey City for the highlight of the day - a return to the Landmark Loews Jersey Theater."
"It's been an extraordinarily wet day. If this were a Thomas Hardy novel I'd be fighting for my life by now, with some unspecified fever. As it is, I just have slightly muddy trousers.

"“Embedding a customer service mindset” goes beyond outward appearances, masked employees, and careful placement of sanitary facilities. The mindset depends of values – shared values of company and employee. No trading of ideas, complaints, concerns? No engagement.

"On Sunday, we were able to head south to Kokomo to visit Steph’s grandma and celebrate Thanksgiving with her. We had a good meal and a great time seeing her; it has been awhile since she’s been able to see Levi in person, but she’s been one of his strongest supporters since day one. We love you grandma, and it was so nice to spend the day with you. We are happy that it’s a short work week; later this week we will head down to celebrate Thanksgiving with Steph’s family, then down to my family after that. We are all looking forward to the Thanksgiving holiday. It has always been my favorite. In my mind, it seems to be the last pure holiday. I know the crazy shopping commences the day after, and some families seem to jump right over it to get to the craziness of Christmas quicker, but maybe that’s why I like it so much. The day is what it needs to be. It’s a day set aside to give thanks for who you are, who you’re with, what you have, and where you’re going. It’s about family, community, and reflection. Add in a great meal and spice it with a little football, and there you have it. The perfect holiday. And I thank God that I can spend it with my family complete."

My favorite tea shop--Mariage Frères--was an easy stroll from my studio. My favorite teeny, tiny Paris parks were quiet and welcoming every hour of the day, and whenever I needed a ""pretty fix,"" I could wander down the rue Vielle du Temple and stop in at Le Jardin Moghul for their quilted, hand-block-printed Rajasthani garments. That's where I got pieces like the quilted jacket covered with big poppies worn a few weeks ago."

That would be a hell of a party, I can assure you."
"Depending on the sort of story you're writing, this isn't necessarily a problem. In a dorky sci-fi story like this one, that obviously isn't taking itself too seriously, readers typically aren't going to take the scientific explanations too seriously, either. If your story is magical or implausible, your readers probably won't be looking for a reasonable explanation for things. J.K. Rowling didn't have to explain the physics that allow broomsticks to fly; Stephenie Meyer didn't need to go into detail about exactly how many of Edward's internal organs still functioned normally. This little tidbit is probably most important for historical fiction and science-based novels like those by Michael Crichton - the history and science need to be believeable."
"I took my couple of steps, which is all they wanted to start with anyways, then got back in bed feeling very ill. Told the nurses I wanted OFF that morphine pump! Okay, they would switch me to Demoral by mouth. It seemed okay at first, at least I wasn't feeling sick."

"It used to be that when you went over they would slow your service down so much that you could maybe get your email to open, but that was it. If you called they would sometimes let it go and reset it and other times you just had to wait twenty four hours. Recently they came up with a new system where if you go over you could pay five bucks and bingo your speed has been restored or you can wait twenty four hours. Since they started two months ago we have somehow gone over our limit around ten times. A few days ago I spent an hour on the phone trying to get the tech support guy to tell me what the hell they had changed so that I could avoid this. He of course assured my that nothing had changed and as a sign of good faith reset my service without charge, but I know they messed with something. Somehow they changed the way they count the megabytes in order to get customers to pay a little more. Right now I have no options because they have a monoploy on the market.

He can electrocute as many people he wants to with battery cables, impale them on umbrellas, strangle them with car antennae, and shoot innocent bystander after innocent bystander - but he is not a threat: he's more like a ""Saturday Night Live"" character they introduce at about the 1:00 AM mark."

Performed by just one man in the cavernous space of the Lyttleton, this is the most sublimely affecting theatre I’ve seen in years. Cillian Murphy is an astonishing actor and the star of two of my favourite films of the last fifteen years: Disco Pigs and 28 Days Later.

Another favorite fairy tale of mine is THE LITTLE MERMAID. I know where this one comes from. 1) Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID was my favorite movie when it first came out.

I really do think that Disney and Ariel are partially to blame for this obsession.

"From education to the environment, those in the know would be able either to push a new administration towards their own fields of opportunity or anticipate the business that new ministers would create. Organisations such as the ANC's PBF, and possibly clones of Britain's Chemistry Club, will be in the pound seats, selling time with those who can sell access to wealth for the people excluded by the current elite."
"In 2007 after losing her husband, Mark, in a plane crash, she decided to change careers. At this time she was informed that the photographs she took in Africa for her Mother In-Law’s charity, Hands of Hope, helped to raise thousands of dollars for them. At this point she decided to pursue photography as a profession by enrolling in classes at Columbia College. The following years Sarah spent traveling around the world taking photographs for various Charities as Sarah Wauterlek Photography. She has exhibited her work downtown LA with RAW Artists and was chosen as a semi-finalist."
"My husband and I were anxiously awaiting our 20 week ultrasound – it was right before Christmas and we could not wait to go home and tell our family the sex of the baby. Right away I could tell that something was wrong. As I watched the tech measure my baby the measurements seemed so small: 17w2d head, 16w5d arm, 17w3d belly, etc. The tech then asked me why I was here so early for my 20 week ultrasound. I told her that I was 20 weeks today and that I was not early. She didn’t seem overly concerned and just reported that my dates had to be wrong. I knew that my dates were not wrong, I had had an ultrasound almost every week up until week 11 and the baby had measured correct the whole time. Once my ultrasound was finished we went to talk to the doctor. He was not able to give us any information other than our baby girl was measuring four weeks behind and that her umbilical cord was a two vessel cord instead of a three vessel cord. I was told to try and gain some weight (I had only gained about 3-4 pounds thus far) and to come back in three weeks to see if she had grown. It was hard to stay optimistic over Christmas. Friends and family were telling us that things were going to be just fine, that she was just going to be a small baby, but this mama knew differently. I knew that there was something seriously wrong and I knew that I was never going to be bringing my baby home."
"Waterproofs come next, and not word of a lie, my favourite cost me six euros from a Decathlon store in France. It's a brown pertex smock that packs the size of a large sandwich; it's featherlite, windproof and even supposedly breathable - and it's cut like a bin bag which means you can slip it over almost anything. They're available in the UK but any pac-a-mac equivalent will do. Of course, I wouldn't use this as my only waterproof on a full day in the hills with a threatening sky - but for most times, when the worst that happens is you get a bit damp before heading to the caff, I'd pack it in preference to coat that cost fifty times more."

"Quinn’s fourth fabulous mystery (see WALLA WALLA SUITE and HOMICIDE, MY OWN) is an excellent thriller filled with twists that keep readers wondering what next as nothing is quite like it seems. The heroine has a need to know re Krapp though she wishes that wasn’t so while the Bruno scenario just will not go away. With Beckman encouraging her to get involved and help on his case while assisting her with the calls, readers will appreciate Quinn’s adventures as she is caught in the crosshairs by The Other Romanian."

"We did a ton of baking this year, sharing with lots of folks. These are cookies that we made to take to some of our neighbors. Since we're in a ""transition kitchen"", there were several times that I would start projects and then remember that I didn't have my normal tools for the job. The night we decorated these cookies was no exception. However, necessity is the mother of invention and I learned several tricks that work great, including how to make my own colored sugar!"
"Here again I find myself agreeing with Deirdre LeFaye: it’s a collaboration (see her Family Record). The text is just too sharp (adult) and adept in its pulling out of precisely the most memorable scenes of Pollexfen’s abduction of Harriet Bryon (Vol 1, letter 29); astute observations about human nature from Grandison on a few occasions (and scattered in the original text); strong lines (“I will not be bribed into liking your wit”); and funny ones of the type we find in her Juvenilia: to me who have read Grandison and written a chapter of my dissertation on this book, the best of these is his sister, Charlotte, Lady G, explaining why Sir Charles has hitherto not fallen in love or courted anyone: he hasn’t the time, “for he is constantly going from one place to another. But what for, we cannot tell”. There are lines from from Vol 4, Letters 14 & 15, Vol 6, Letter 43 — could a child get that far?"

"Collins does a good job of building Katniss as a believable character and creating a strong, realistic bond with Peeta. The book is very accessible to a wide audience as it has a good deal of action, suspense, and even some romance for those fans inclined to that genre. Note, Collis does a good job of straddling the line with the romantic angle which could easily have turned many readers off. She never gets too sappy, but does give readers looking for romance just the right amount to keep them engaged."
"All things considered, Ghostbusters is still a abundant bold no bulk which adjustment you get. While I wouldn't acclaim the Red Fly adjustment over the Terminal Absoluteness version, if all you accept is a Wii or PS2, and you're a Ghostbusters fan, you shouldn't be aghast by what this adjustment has to offer. If I was to accord it a annual based on what I've played, I'd accord it a solid 8.0."

"Outside food sources that attract rodents include garbage, dog and cat food, dog feces, birdseed, and fruits or berries that have fallen to the ground. Take away their sources of food outside, and rodents will look for another neighborhood to live. Pick up fruit and vegetables in your yard. A honeycomb can feed hundreds of mice all winter, so carefully remove any beehives in the immediate area. Birds are messy eaters, which is especially helpful to rodents. So quit feeding the birds for the duration of the infestation. If you’re feeding the squirrels; you’re also feeding rodents. If at all possible, feed your pets indoors. If you must feed your pets outside, remove their food 30 minutes after serving. Otherwise, whatever you’re pet doesn’t eat, rodents will. Since rats are nocturnal, feed your outdoor pet well before dark."

"Victorious characters can either take over the motte and bailey, which has no peasants around it so it must be supported by raiding, burn it down, or give it to the lord they feasted with on the way to the conflict. Although there are only three horses here, characters might take the livestock, although it is stolen property, so they can never sell it in good faith. Similarly, most of the items of treasure found here should be the grave-goods of someone or other, so to keep it might prove unfortunate and Pious Saxons will insist on destroying everything they can lay their hands on."

"These eye openers, fog cutters, and morning glories came in many forms and included almost anything that could potentially soften the effects of a hangover. Therefore, the ingredients were often a matter of taste. Perhaps the chosen cure combined a bit of milk and sugar mixed with your morning dram. After absinthe became popular, it often found its way into many anti-fogmatics, mostly because of its refreshing flavor and stomach settling powers. Its extreme potency was usually tamed with some sweetener and ice. Other pick-me-ups revolved around citrus and employed its tart flavors, not to mention the natural sugars and vitamins, to help bring the sparkle back to eyes clouded over with heaviness. The truth is that when strong morning tipples were common--and we're not talking about today's tame bloody marys and mimosas--everything was fair game. An entire category of drinks, with clever monikers, was devoted to helping the masses face a new day, often in spite of the one before."

Some teachers I know had far more. All this happened when inspections lasted a whole week.

All this talk of ""shake-ups"" is happening for another reason - one to which I have alluded before."

Students engaged in this model would address academic tasks through collaboration, cooperation, and group investigations."

"5.) When I was a kid, my mom and I would often travel back and forth from Manila to Batangas. We would leave Batangas very early like 4am. To get out of our house in Batangas, we had to pass by the stone walls. It was dark but I tried my best to look at the cracks between the stones, vigilantly watching if a snake would come out of those cracks. Our house in batangas had really tall talahib grass, so it isn’t entirely impossible that there were a couple snakes in the area. Our cat once killed a baby snake under our bed. Several years after, I told my mom about this fear and she was really surprised. She said “I thought you were really brave because even if it was so dark and scary, but you didn’t say a thing.” I said “I didn’t say a thing because I was trying to be brave, and I was too busy watching out for the snakes.” I am not afraid of Batangas anymore."

File this one under both “teacher” and “daddy.” As a boy growing up in the Eighties, I learned United States geography through college basketball conference affiliation. Some glorious weekend in October, Dick Vitale’s College Basketball Yearbook would hit the local drugstore’s magazine rack, and I would giddily grab it and run to my mother yelling “It’s here today! Can I get it?!” She always said “Yes,” and the stat-ogling would begin. When I grew tired of marveling at how many points Reggie Miller or Reggie Williams averaged or at the size of the Carrier Dome or at the enrollment at Texas, I moved on to drawing uniforms and mascots. Eventually, at some point, this rural Kentucky boy would dig up a map of the United States and hunt for places like Corvallis, Oregon, or Lafayette, Louisiana. I made it a point to know all of the Division I teams, their colors, and their mascots."

"First, as a result of the summer earthquake, the dedication was postponed from August until October. And, as soon as the monument was revealed to the public, criticism poured in. For me, the first problem was aesthetic: It was not that the image of Rev. King emerging from the rock was too gray, stern or forbidding, as some critics said. (That’s just philistinism.) Rather: the whole thing just seemed too cautious and tame. First, it just isn’t very well done. Second, and more important: Is there really a point to a conventional, representational portrait sculpture in an age in which the most powerful (and eventually popular) monuments: the Vietnam Memorial, the new 9-11 memorial site, and the Berlin Monument to the Murdered Jews of Europe draw upon a more modern language of abstraction? The King monument, its very real appeals notwithstanding, could fit perfectly well in a neo-Stalinist sculpture garden or political cemetery. (Philosopher Cornel West went even further, though in a very different direction, declaring that King would have wanted a “revolution,” not a monument.)"

"This year THON raised $10,686,924.83 For The Kids. That is amazing. Almost every student organization and any other willing org. raises money for THON each year. I have never felt something so incredible. People can hate on Penn State as much as they want but nothing will ever make me doubt the pride I feel for my school. People everywhere do horrendous things each day and all of those get reported with the worst of them being nick picked at every day. However, only few people can say that they actually made a difference. Penn State makes a difference every day and brightens the life of several kids who, without the help of THON and the Four Diamonds organization may not have had a second chance at life. Despite the claims that Penn State is no longer a reputable school, we all know the truth. The truth is that Penn State will actually be remembered for its amazing efforts in helping society and not the negative events the media reports now."
"Not until it happens to you do you realise how easily you can end up in prison, and once you do, no-one will ever listen to you again. Declaring your innocence becomes denial, evidence supporting you is circumstantial and dismissed, witnesses for you are intimidated and ignored, witnesses against you are primed by police and told what to say, how to ensure the maximal sentence – and don’t forget, the worse the conviction the greater the compensation cheque."
"As for me, I have my jewels (my children.) My treasures (their artwork and handmade gifts they’ve given me over the years; family photos; and the like.) And a few things handed down to me from my ancestors–dresses from my mother, grandmothers and a great-grandmother; costume jewelry from my mother and grandmothers; a book about Paris from my grandpa; a table and chairs from a grandmother; a white trunk that traveled from England and carted the entirety of my great-great grandmother, Mary Ann Quinn’s, worldly possessions to Utah in the 1800s; and various family stories, all of which I appreciate because “Family stories make the most valuable heirlooms.” (Unknown)"

"As one who has struggled for years with the problem of war and violence in the Old Testament as well as in the world, I read the article with eagerness. I thought that this article might answer some questions I’ve had or help me clarify my positions on these issues. What a disappointment! It seemed to me to be condescending and based on false dilemmas and red herrings, as well as a selective reading of Scripture, I felt it wouldn’t have been worthy of a C as a college paper. So I dashed off a letter to the magazine giving some of my views."

"I’m a fan of a solidly made Western movie, as you’ll see in the coming days, and Silverado is a fairly .. well, it’s alright. It’s got a huge, talented cast that clearly enjoyed making the picture. However, the writing at times seems to be full of itself, like it’s trying to be all deep ‘n shit when all we want is cowboys shootin’ shit. So to speak. The conversations between Paden (Kevin Kline) and Stella (Linda Hunt) seem to hint at a long forgotten past between the two of them, but it’s mostly just air. Then there are the storylines that start and stop abruptly, as if no one would believe Paden would get together with Hannah (Rosanna Arquette) so they just picked one of the other dudes that wasn’t the black one."

"When I read this in my little book, I got teary eyed. It summed up so much of what parenting is to me. We wish to have all the answers, but in reality we learn so much from our children. To me, it's a vivid picture of the depth and weight of my responsibility as a Mother. Especially being one that has chosen to stay home with her children, and will school them within the home as well. A cloak of responsibility is what it feels like, not heavy like I'm being smothered, but rather a cloak of new identity."

"So life is made up of good days and bad days. Yesterday was a good one :) Nothing outrageous happened but things were simple, sweet and I took time to appreciate how great life is. Studio was busy, classes were awesome and lots of new members signed up!! I came home and Tanner was sleeping even though the cleaners were buzzing around and vacuuming right outside his door-he just slept like a champ(for 3 hours-he never naps that long-it was heaven!!!)!! Kevin got home early and so we walked the pups then had a glass of Chardonnay on our patio. I spent a lot of time while preggo on our patio reading and relaxing and it was so surreal to now have this amazing baby sitting on my lap bc it just feels like yesterday that I was rubbing my bump and feeling his kicks out there. Time sure does fly. We grilled up some tri tip and put the munchkin down early and talked and ate and enjoyed each other :) It was just so nice.

"I just woke up from a 30-minute afternoon nap which contained a very odd but symbolic dream. I dreamed that my friend and I rode an indoor roller coaster. Only, you know how most legit roller coasters have a safety bar or some sort of safety apparatus that holds you in the seat? In case of some deathly incident that may or may not occur? Well, this one in my dream did not have such a safety thing. It did have a small belt strap (the kind that are on the ends of backpack straps) that go across your waist. Annnd that's it."

"He fell in love with a countess named Sophie, a lady-in-waiting who wasn’t quite blue-blooded enough for a Habsburg, so they carried on secretly for two years and he refused to consider anyone else. Finally Franz Joseph said okay, but it had to be a morganatic marriage. That meant any children would have no claim to the throne. Ferdinand agreed and he and Sophie were married in 1900. Morganatic also meant that Sophie could not share his rank - on any formal occasion Ferdinand would be right next to the Emperor, but Sophie had to stand at the end of the line."

"Before we headed home again on Tuesday, Chatsworth was on the itinerary. Of course, we couldn't have foreseen the torrentialness (if that's not a word, it should be) of the deluge in which we took down the tent, nor the extent of our bedragglement as we trudged - in wellies, gently steaming as we dried out - around the most magnificent house in England. Given time, Daughter #1 might possibly forgive me for making her spend her summer holidays visiting the dead, but showing up at Mr Darcy's house looking like refugees from Glastonbury may take therapy. The house guides were very kind, possibly because we looked like people who weren't really used to being Indoors, and the wallpaper was lovely, but a bottle of water cost £1.50, which made me think rather more kindly about the warm, free water in Buxton. It is a truth universally acknowledged that a man in possession of a large fortune probably got it by fleecing tourists."
"Ended the day with some planning of my year. Because with Esteff, since she only has 3 months left she’s stressing a little with everything she wants to do before she leaves. So I was inspired to start early with my list of places to go. First things first. I need to open a savings account. For all my travelling and of course taxes. (Everyone that doesn’t know I came on the worst time of the year for tax reasons. I’ll pay the most, since I worked the whole year basically!)"
"“Vanya, come in. Bronislav.” The static remained. Kostya saw his footsteps that led him to the cave, and traced them back around the large rock formation. Trying again and again to reach his comrades. The static did not let up. He entered into the crystalline grove. The buggy was no where to be seen and the prismatic stones were all gone.

Five minutes or five years, they would always appear the same."
"I've been busy the last couple of days. Making and painting. I've been fighting a headache on and off since Monday morning, so I gave up on housework and when it subsided in the afternoons I decided to do something fun rather than cleaning. And I have a good reason to get moving on the creative front, I've committed to this Art Expo in a month, so need to get some smaller works done for my booth/stall. I've never had an art stall before, so this will be a learning experience. I'm keeping expectations fairly low, I hope I can cover my costs and learn some useful things about running a stall, and anything on top of that will be icing on the cake."

"I’ve had people tell me, “I don’t feel like saying nice things…” or “I just felt they needed a piece of my mind!” Well, I didn’t feel like getting up this morning- but I did. Why? I had responsibilities. My future as well as my current quality of life depended on me getting up and doing what I was committed to today. If we only do what we feel like doing we will never be successful. What about the morning we wake up and don’t feel married? Or better yet, what about when we don’t feel saved? The Bible teaches us that we MUST “walk by faith” and not by our feelings and emotional impulses. We have to choose to speak positive words because they are shaping and directing our lives."
"What was expected to be the depressing final chapter of a motorsport legacy, turned out to be (to the surprise of all) the blossoming of a new and uplifting chapter in the Pescarolo story. During yesterday’s liquidation sale, OAK Motorsport team owner Jacques Nicolet and Joel Rivière, owner of Prestige Racing, secured the purchase of vital PescaroloSport assets. The joint venture saw the pair acquire both Pescarolo P01 chassis, in addition to an array of assorted technical support equipment (valued at over US $550,000) crucial to team operations."
"The children and I absolutely adore the Honey Stingers. We enjoy the honey based flavors and that we aren't eating a ton of processed sugars or added soy in them. We like that they are very tasty, especially the children who beg for them. I like that they are shelf stable, small, and easy to pack with me when I know that we will need that extra boost to get me through. Three kids on a bike ride or long walk alone can be especially taxing. We take them with us on bike rides (about 3 miles) and long walks (about 2 miles) for that extra energy boost to keep us going."

One of the toughest times in our relationship was when Richard had to go away for basic training. Being away from each other was absolute torture for both of us. Although this was one of the most difficult times for us, it also made us truly appreciate one another more. It tested our love, devotion, and loyalty to each other. When Richard finally returned home we decided that there was nothing more we wanted than to spend the rest of our lives together. Nine months later, our love child, Alina Pembroke Sann was born."

"The closing, long story short, follows a legal dispute among heirs with various interests in the building at 27 Prince, which includes apartments and the two sides of Ray’s: the pizzeria and an Italian restaurant, each with its separate entrance, but sharing a kitchen and the corporation name, Ray’s of Prince Street. When the Ray in Ray’s, one of the owners of the building, died in 2008, a row arose over whether the restaurant’s lease was valid and whether it should pay rent. A lawsuit was filed in 2009 and settled this year."

In Merlyn’s Raven, love is timeless, mysterious, and dangerous, just like the dark age and land in which it’s set. I hope you’ll all come along for the adventure and share in Gwendydd’s and Myrddin’s story."

First off I have to say I am very happy about this, as I’m sure are many fans. One of the big reasons for the dislike of the ending is the lack of closure, but I feel Bioware should also look into other things to consider when expanding on this ending. I am also aware that Bioware will not see this post but am putting it up regardless."
"The surgery went well. They had to remove the colon because of where the tumor was at. The surgeon didn’t see any other cancer in the nearby organs or lymph nodes. For that we are very thankful. They will still test to see what stage it is in and if any other treatment is necessary. It was a relief to know that it doesn’t seem to have spread. Plus, without a colon, cancer cannot reappear there. She is doing well and we are praying for a speedy recovery and a good report on the test results."

Stacey’s family lived at the back of her mother’s hairdressing shop on Rotherham Terrace, Miramar in Wellington (NZ) – know the place? It had the 80′s pink and black sign writing on the window well into the 90′s. Stacey was way cool, she had the Grease record (we never even had a record player), her mum had big hair and smoked – and was pretty relaxed about things. Even when the dog ate the whole birthday cake at her party held in the salon. And she had cool jewellery, actually I pinched an orange plastic bangle from her once – I am so sorry Stace."

As a consumer, I don’t want it to be difficult to shop for products I like and find worthwhile. If I have to struggle through an endless array of cheap products to find the good ones, this lessens the value of my shopping experience and lowers my expectation of the products as a whole."

Anyone who has cared to peruse these pages or who have been clients of mine know that is not the case. I made the argument of where I stand on self-publishing and the publishing industry in my article Publishing: Advocate or Be Damned. I'll not repeat it here. I'm happy simply to say that no matter what I or others say about the complexity and difficulties that face self-published authors, more now than ever, that authors are still going to decide to self-publish. I'd just like to give them the best possible chance they can of success; by thoroughly reviewing print and publishing services and shining a light on the publishing industry as it develops and changes."

"In my group we had people from the Ukraine, Gambia, DRC, Cameroon, Pakistan, Uganda, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Jamaica and the Phillipines. Few of them had written poetry before and many were struggling with English as a second language. All of our participants were migrants, refugees, asylum seekers or undocumented, trying to establish a foothold in London and make a new life for themselves. Many people came with very difficult stories of why they had left their homes, families, children, farms and businesses behind. Some people have been here for many years with still no hope of being granted the right to stay. But everyone said that they had come to the workshop to write down their stories, to improve their English and to meet other people."
"Now let’s look at unfruitfulness. I am sure that you noticed that ἄκαρπος, “unfruitful” is the same word as καρπὸς, “fruitful” or “fruit,” with a ἄ prefix. This the same thing we do in English by putting a prefix of “a” on a word to make it mean the exact opposite. So, if we put the “alpha-negative” on the front of καρπὸς, which means fruitful, we have a word that means “unfruitful, fruitless, barren, or unproductive,” and that is exactly how ἄκαρπος is used in the New Testament. It is found eight times in the New Testament. In the parable of the Sower in Matthew 13 it refers to the “thorny ground hearer.” In the book of Jude it is used to refer to apostates who are “clouds…without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots…”"

"The designer rarely gets a credit on the acknowledgements page of the book, but they should. Their work is more visible to the reader than that of the editor or the proofreader. A useful trick for writers struggling with a book they can't evaluate is to print it out in a different font. Text looks different in a different font. The book you wrote in Arial (yuk) or Times New Roman (yuk) will look quite different if you print it in Goudy Old Style or Palatino. Suddenly, you can see the book with fresh eyes. Now - does your book suit a spindly, spidery font or an elegant, crisp font? Does that curly 'Q' really work? Do you have to change the font because of the style of one letter? (I often do.) *Now* you see what the book designer does."

Do you have any books where your own personal experience, unrelated to the story itself, left you with a less-than-good feeling about it?"

"Proficiency can be assessed the same way you assessed students under a points-based system, with quizzes, tests, papers, and projects. One difference is each particular question has anywhere from one to many learning objectives associated with it. Since students can reassess on a particular learning objective, they have an incentive to use the assessment to study for reassessment. In this way the assessment becomes part of the learning process and students will read your comments and try to figure out what they did wrong."

I can lay personal claim to having murdered Bono and lyrically shitting on his grave on at least five separate occasions."

They don’t use what’s called a SIM card, so you can’t unlock them. The US is the major country with CDMA networks, although Canada, Mexico, India, Japan and South Korea also use them. If you buy a used CDMA phone, it will have to be used with the carrier it was programmed for."

"-Hillary Clinton is unelectable. If the Democrats wish to re-take the White House they must find someone who can win in the Republican strongholds, like Evan Bayh. I must say though, even being from Indiana, there is something about Bayh that makes me question whether he’s actually presidential material. But he is a Democrat who can win in normally Republican country. Unlike John Edwards, who had zero influence even in his own home state (as was also the case with Al Gore), Bayh would likely take Indiana and swing Ohio over to the Democrats, which would almost assuredly win the race."

"Pacing is frequently a challenge, particularly for a long manga, but I think this one works despite its length largely because the cast is so diverse and complex (rather than pat standard side characters). Although there is a potential for the shojo standard reverse harem (one girl with many male potential admirers), it's generally more family-like with really only Yuki and Kyo as serious potential love interests. The side stories and complicated emotional histories of the various characters have considerable depth and, frequently, charm. Sometimes, they are downright heart-wrenching and it's somewhat intriguing to me how the author used the silly premise to highlight some key family interactions. Momiji's past (and his Tohru-like acceptance) of a horrific situation was particularly touching for me."

Well for one thing, it’s only painfully obvious that this has been ripped from the pages of a book because a) it says so in the opening credits and b) you can kind of tell with hindsight that there was probably a good few important scenes that were cut but which would have made the film make a little more holistic sense. By that I mean that characters would have been fleshed out and developed more which is a dire necessity here. Yes, there is mystery and you’re not supposed to know what’s going on but you are supposed to know what’s going on in the bits they tell you what’s going on right?"

"One of the problems we face as Lay Disciples of Jesus, is that the modern church is not structured to properly assist lay people, who are not part of the “religious establishment”, to follow the personal path of discipleship the Lord is calling them to follow. The modern church establishment does not expect lay people to enter into such individual callings. The establishment expects that any one who has such a call to either enter a seminary to become a priest, deacon, or minister or to join some religious order. It is difficult to overcome the prejudices of the past that have placed lay Christians as passive , un-empowered, servants of the clergy, having no understanding of things spiritual."

"The issue came when the recommendations were given, and only the percentage of complaints and issues were addressed. Someone didn’t do the math. If you have a 5% complaint rate for in-person reps, but you have 1000 reps, but a 50% complaint rate for 100 docs using an online tool, which one has the bigger problem and should be addressed first? If you’re a stats person without time to think, you say the big old negative one, the 50% problem one. If you have a brain, you say, uh, the rep one, because while both net out at 50 complaints, the rep has a higher chance of pissing people off long term, a higher rate of conversion when done correctly, and 100 docs on an online app doesn’t make for a decent pool for stats."
"Well, most often the answer to it all is ‘No. Yes. Sometimes’.

"I have since decided to pick up a book used in RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) that I’ve had sitting on my bookshelf for years and have been reading a bit of it here and there. The first chapter, of course, deals with God calling humanity to a close relationship with him through the salvation offered through Jesus’ sacrifice. This led me to think about the divinity of Jesus. Do I personally believe that, if Jesus existed, he was divine? Not by any means do I believe that. This prompted me to double-check the facts as to what Catholics and other Christian denominations believe as far as Jesus’ divinity goes; of course, Catholics believe Jesus was divine, seeing him as half-God, half-man, which automatically disqualifies me from even considering becoming Catholic, nevermind the blaring fact that Jesus isn’t the messiah."

"The journey that we started 6 years ago TODAY changed our lives... there were really, really bad and dark times... but there were also very uplifting, loving, and hysterically funny times.

Parker started memorizing my school schedule & would conveniently pop outside of my classrooms smoking a cigarette. At first it was a cute coincidence, but it became unattractive pretty quickly. As I said before, the difference between creepy & cute is how mutual the attraction is. And taboo or not, I was not digging Professor Parker."

I will let you do the detective work out what day that was last week! LOL. I made the tag shape too, cutting out her name and layering an off-cut from the dps (well, I don't like waste when it can be put to good use), from the front of the card placing it behind the cut-work so that it would peep through for a bit of added interest. I have written who the card is from (as if she didn't know!! LOL), on the reverse of the tag before slipping it into the pocket. The ribbon was from my stash."

"Another time, back when I was sick for a few weeks in March, I had to run across the road to drop off someone to school, and I’d just got out of the shower so my hair was still damp. I happened to complain about my illness to a Spanish woman, and she said something like, “well of course – this is very dangerous” while she lifted a piece of my hair. She insinuated that was why all my kids and I had been sick for the last couple of weeks. I was fuming but didn’t know enough Spanish to make a comeback."

"As Becky’s husband of over 33 years, I have put together for her a final health update. Only week or so before we lost her, when it first became clear how this was likely to turn out, she asked me to write a synopsis of the history of her illness, with more details about the later stages, for a final blog entry she wanted to make about this. The reason for my involvement was to save her time and effort; she would edit my draft to make it her own without the need to do all the writing from scratch. I began right away, but I did not get it ready for her soon enough. There was a lot going on, and we all thought we would have more time—probably a few weeks. However, I have decided finally to complete this task as best I can and get it posted for her at last. She would have converted it all to first person as she modified it into her own words, of course, but I don’t think I can really do that for her."
"The third cause for controversy was Þeyr's decision to perform in full Nazi regalia. Contrary to most of the other bands in the doc, Þeyr weren’t filmed during a concert. Instead, an ‘acted’ ‘music video’ was used to present the band. It shows the members goose step in Nazi gear towards the Icelandic president's house at Bessastaðir in-between shots of them rocking out in their rehearsal space (which was conveniently located at Álftanes, right next to Bessastaðir). Their Nazi get-up spurred the heated debate ""Are Þeyr Nazis on top of being snobs?"" The band of course denied all Nazi accusations. They did it ambivalently though, using the old ""it was a joke"" explanation."

"Fundamentalism has a varied history. In the early 20th century, the fundamentalist movement was responsible for directly and rightly combating the modernest heresies springing forth from within many of that day’s primary theological institutions. Yet, like the Ephesian church, while it began as a right and just movement against doctrines and practices that were contrary to Scripture, the fundamentalist movement has more recently become known more for its attacks on those within and outside the church than its love for the Lord and for his people."

"A mezzanine level around the perimeter of the cover building allows a full appreciation of the floor plan of the villa, most of whose flint and mortar foundation walls still remain to a height of a couple of feet or more. A huge number of finds are on show in display cases – from decorative beads and jewellery to more mundane finds: pottery, tools, nails, padlocks, gaming counters, household goods, geese skeletons (possibly sacrificed). And roof tiles, many of which were imprinted with foot prints of animals – dogs, cats, geese, oxen – as they lay in the sun to dry. For me, the roof tiles give perhaps the most vivid indication of what life around the villa may have been like: somewhat hectic, with animals roaming at will around a busy farmyard, geese flapping, dogs barking… And just as we gain an insight into life at Lullingstone, we also glimpse death: two skeletons are on show, one of an adult male found with grave goods in a lead casket decorated with scallop-shell detail, the other, more chillingly, that of a baby."

"The obvious problem is, of course, that such an imposition seems to violate the liberty of the students. Since they are adults, there is a presumption in favor of their right to dress as they choose. Naturally, this should match the laws regarding public indecency (although those could be challenged as well). However, provided the students are not violating such laws, it would seem reasonable to not impose on their liberty. Unless, of course, the harm done by specific attire would morally warrant imposing on the liberty of the students. This takes me to the second reason."

"How a religion formulates its relationship with pain is very telling. Is it good for you, as the older book religions sometimes suggest? Or is it something we can and should avoid, as modern society seems generally keener on as an idea?

"As the eclipse slowly covered more of the moon, I lay down under the bare branches of the birch tree, against the shadowy, dark roots spreading beneath it, closed my eyes and felt the cold earth against my back. I could almost sense the movement, the slow tilting away, as the moon fell below the horizon and out of sight, leaving the total eclipse to those further to the west."
"The day has finally came and went! It went by all so fast but so slow at the same time! The few days before, I was a bundle of nerves. Bundle of nerves is an understatement. I was a wreck. I was nervous, scared, excited, happy, etc etc.. As with anything with the Army..things ALWAYS change. As the weeks went by and the end of the deployment ended, the final date changed at least 4 times. Shoot, it even changed within the last 48 hours. He originally was supposed to be home on Sunday night around 10pm but on Saturday around noon we found out that we were not going to be seeing him until Monday morning...my heart sank...but after my initial ""down"" time, I came to accept that God knew what was best for our family and for all of the other soldiers. Monday morning is what it was going to be...but now I had 2 more days to wait! AHHHH!!!"

"But, we’d rather find the remote and turn on the TV. Why? Because it’s painless and it probably involves less change. Instead of making changes, we can just stare and watch, and find entertainment in the idea of change, without actually having the discomforts of making change. Sometimes the remote feels safer. The book is less invasive. A stranger is easier to agree with my rationale. But does it really help when things get sticky?"

Those of you from Eventing-A-Gogo may remember all the outraged backlash I received when I mentioned breeding Gogo, who was a far superior mare to Sophie if we are all to be honest with ourselves. As just a few examples, try here, and here, and here, and here, and me finally losing my marbles in frustration here. The comments on all of those posts hurt ya'll. They hurt. They really made me feel awful about myself, which is such a crying shame... I don't know any of these people in real life, why would their opinions make me feel like such a terrible person? Apparently, I am not made of as tough of stuff as I thought."

"‘Gangsters de Paris’ was the evening’s theme, a look back at some famous affairs from the beginning of the 20th century. The venue was well chosen as it is situated close to the home of the first topic discussed, the infamous ‘Apache’ gangs who stalked Belleville at the turning of the new century. Sylvanie de Lutèce was able to point out local landmarks that featured in her story, and kept the audience gripped with tales of sharp-dressed hoodlums and ‘marmites’, the girlfriends of the gang members who often gave as good as they got."

"A crack of thunder split the mottled pearl gray clouds scudding over the tops of the trees. Godl blinked in surprise, gold-green orbs wide open on the rebound. They shone like polished metal even in the dimmer light of the undergrowth. A small chuff escaped past his muzzle. Godl opened wide and bared fangs scarcely gone dull in the years since his first kill. Drawing a deep breath, he inhaled the jade scent of the forest, mineral tang of wet stone and the metallic chill of the river down below. Had the jaguar been possessed of a historian's mind, he would have recalled that first kill, an unlucky agouti Godl had pounced upon in the brush not far away. The wretched creature had squeaked loudly until the unrelenting force of Godl's jaws broke its neck."
"The music grew louder, more insistent, opposing other sound from reaching her ears. Every vibration of the melody shredded into her body unravelling her being.

"When we got downstairs, the pub was packed. ""Too late,"" I thought, ""we've lost our table"". Sitting at 'our' table and all those in the vicinity of the small room by the fire and the three Irish musicians playing were, oh, twenty-four or so wild Irish men in town for a stag party. ""No worries,"" the barmaid declared, ""they'll be moving along in an hour's time."" When we saw her deliver another round and another, we conceded defeat and chose alternate seating. Or should I say standing? I stood in a doorway, peering in and watching as the night's events unfolded."

"In the email below, sent in January of 2011, McGinniss reveals that his manuscript, then under legal review at Crown/Random House, could not prove its most headline-grabbing allegations. And yet, many of these “salacious stories” that lacked “proof” (in McGinniss’s own words) ended up in the book, and on televisions everywhere during the author’s current media tour … without proper sourcing, and without any apparent new evidence to support them."

"As I got older and became a writer, I knew I wanted to write about it. But I didn't trust myself to write a historical novel or a literary novel -- I'm not a particular fan of either genre as a reader, and I'm a big believer that you should write the kind of book you love."
"This is a must read novel! A completely different take on vampires, Fukuda has created an intriguing, captivating, fast paced novel that readers won’t be able to put down. Going into the novel, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but like Fukuda’s previous novel, Crossing, it grabbed my attention from the get go, spurring me on until the very last page, when I screamed in agony over the cliffhanger that I’ll have to live with for the next year, until I can get my hands on the sequel of this compelling novel. Alas, it’s so worth it."
"The government urges us in this case to uphold a direct prohibition on political speech. It asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concerns."
"It’s amazing that they were able to keep it exciting even for people who already read the stories. Moriarty for instance seems to be involved in all his cases, wich is a little different from the books. Overall everything is much faster and more adventerous and his deductions are slightly more obvious than in the books, but it is still so much fun to watch."
"Putting aside the overblown narrative of the record, setting aside its indefensibly bloated length, and you'd have a truly amazing record. With them (although I'm not convinced having an incoherent narrative is actually a point against it), and you have a great album that features some of the best guitar lines in the history of rock. ""Ten Speed (Of God's Blood and Burial)"" (which I guess is about a delusional conversation with a ten-speed bike? Man, some of the songs on this record push ridiculous to new heights) has, by any conceivable measure, one of the great guitar solos. ""The Suffering"" continues the grand tradition begun in ""Junesong Provision;"" that is, mixing pop song structure with guitar-based riffing. The multi-part song expands to four sections, and starts to drag on a bit as it goes on, and it's also the first Coheed record with a Parental Advisory sticker, which isn't a bad thing so much as it's jarring, like hearing your mother say ""fuck."""

"There is something about it that is so pure, untouched — unqualified even. In the history of man, very little has been done to corrupt, or even direct the energy here, and so it can be a little difficult to work with.

"There was a bewildering assortment of false starts and incomplete sentences for the mind only. I no sooner thought of something to say to myself than I forgot it, and I was lucky to get beyond the second or third imagined word. Of course no one in his right mind overheard any of this, the dumb speaking to the silent in a reverse image, so no one was upset. But if this happens 50 or 60 times, one wants a little revenge of some sort. Of course, one was in all probability speaking no kind of written English, so this meant that whatever you said was relevant and you could not say anything irrelevant.... Reading, at which I used to be no slouch, now gave me the most incredible, disheveled experiences of my print-bound life. Now print jigged toward me, then it hung back. The one part of it that was readable swam backward or forward to render the reading experience at best incomplete, or subject to the vilest, maddest vagaries of a proofreader’s nightmare.So far I am thoroughly enjoying West's post-stroke prose, and find it much more focused and readable than Ackerman's, so perhaps I'll be content with having heard her radio voice, which seems to absorb better, and in my Amazon shopping cart I'll trade her book for The Shadow Factory."

"But it gets even more complicated, because the groundswell of the press and the people say it is so. Apparently the mystique of the Coliseum is gone. Besides the fact that Arash Markazi is viewed – however unfair it might be – as a Judas by the USC faithful, this article is extremely confused. The mystique of the Coliseum wasn’t the perceived invincibility of the Trojans on their own field, it was how the hell USC fans managed to get over their collective yawning for a few years and turn the place into a semblance of home field advantage. In that respect the mystique is gone: attendance figures are falling and will continue to fall until USC is ranked in the top ten with consistency. But then there’s this: that was the loudest Coliseum crowd I’ve heard in a long time. Ignoring the epic failures of the spirit squad’s contemptible mouse squeaks for chanting, it was a pretty good night crowd-wise. When USC exploded at the beginning of the second half and took the lead I overcame my usual attempts at civility and screamed “Choke! Choke!” at the Oregon fans behind me, then pointed at the silent away crowd in the southeastern end of the Coliseum and screamed, “It’s OK, they’re choking too!” This is very rare, and like all prodigies it foreshadowed events of great happenstance and stature, i.e. silent, glowering hatred and despair when the Ducks decided they were dangerously close to seriously messing up their points per game. Still, I was proud of the 88,000 or so fans who managed to show up and, even more surprisingly, wear red. There is still some shard of that pride left. And it was pretty cool to see the student section forget its apathy and rock out, even if it was to the way overplayed instrumental of Seven Nation Army."

"As many of you know, I have been working on a number of art collaborations over the past few years. Several of them have come to a close in 2010. One of these projects was with Vivian Bonder and Stephanie McAtee. Called Self Contained, this was an out-of-the-box collaboration that focused on feelings that we tend to hide from others and that we could no longer contain. I am happy to say that not only is our project in the January/February 2011 issue of Cloth Paper Scissors but it is featured on the cover."
"Never underestimate the Book Maven. She is very clever and has many talents. Among them is her ability as a proof reader. She has a forensic attention to detail, knows the correct word for everything, her spelling is perfect, and her knowledge of all things grammatical is second to none. I trust her above all others. She especially loves finding things that the copy editor has missed, so when I got the first proof copies of This Is Not Forgiveness, I asked her to read it for me. I knew that if there were mistakes there, she’d find them."
"As in not on the premises so there absolutely was no laborer but me? I realize my yard will never look like a magazine ad but I was hoping to maybe get enough mulch out to keep the moisture from evaporating around the bushes. Hours later I came in to get cleaned up thinking I would join friends and festivities at the local Irishman's Pub. As I was toweling my hair dry I turned on the tv and realized they were calling ""Jockeys up!"". No way could I get hair, make-up, clothing and driving to the pub done in a few minutes. So I went to fetch a beverage and watch the race thinking I would still meet up with friends for the Cinco celebrations."

"5). Justin Blackmon, WR to Jacksonville. I had Blackmon going to the Rams on the 6th pick. That was based on the assumption that Blackmon would be taken by the ”Jags” in the 9th spot. However, because they moved up to 5th, they did take Blackmon. No doubt, like the Rams, Jacksonville QB Gabbert needed another wide out to compliment Robinson. Blackmon should be able to fill the bill nicely."
"Starting this month, the ""Burnet Flea"" expanded to the second and last Sunday of each month from 7am-4pm.

"The bed was warm and toasty, the air in our bedroom was on the chilly side. I didn’t want to get up, so I gave my husband a little nudge. But he was still in a deep sleep and didn’t acknowledge the nudge.

"Furthermore, sometimes a threat is enough. For instance, in the far north of Thailand, powerful businessmen – with government connections (Thailand is an extremely corrupt society), planned to move power plant equipment across the border to a Burmese town that is controlled by drug lords. The equipment was to be used to build a generating plant that would have been fueled with dirty coal. The plant would have spread severe air pollution throughout the region (and provided electricity for narcotics factories). A large group of local Thai villagers rallied and prevented the convoy of trucks carrying the equipment from crossing into Burma, with the threat that if the convoy tried they would destroy the trucks. There was a standstill that lasted weeks but the threat worked. The trucks withdrew and the power plant was never built."

But in our legalistic society, we can’t have that one rule. We have to have a hundred individual rules because we can’t rightfully interpret the one simple rule."

As a result, you are stuck in the giant ectoplasm which takes you for a ride around the festivity."
"Now, let us consider the theory of the majority that it would be a great anomaly to have two legislative bodies, the Legislature and the President to be acting at the same time, each nullifying the acts of the other. I fail to see the suggested anomaly. In fact, under the view and interpretation given by the majority of the delegation of contemplated the simultaneous functioning of the Legislature and the President, both exercising legislative powers. And it is a fact that there were several instances of the legislature and the President both validly and simultaneously exercising legislative powers."
"Anecdote time: Shortly after I moved to New York, I was riding the subway in the Bronx, on my way to work. While sitting on the train, a woman—who was black—sat down next to me in a seat that didn’t exist. Which is to say that three people were already on the subway bench and she decided to sit down anyway, effectively squishing everyone else. Not thrilled with the idea of spending my remaining train ride getting to accidental first base with a fellow passenger, I simply got up and went to stand by the door. This woman—and I remember this vividly—then turned to me and said loudly enough for most of the surrounding car to hear: “Racist.”"

"As of now, even without this ruling, most people who are sent to death row can look forward to twenty years of appeals before their sentence is executed. That’s enough time for many relatives of victims to die of natural causes. Whether or not capital punishment is a deterrent to crime may be debated. What can’t be debated is that a toothless judicial system is an open invitation to criminals who have no reason to fear society’s retribution for any crime."
"The Dani are among the last of the lost tribes, unknown to the world until 1939, when an aircraft chartered by the zoologist Richard Archbold flew over a 6,000ft ridge above the Baliem River, and discovered a secret valley of terraced gardens, dry-stone walls and cosy little villages, populated by a people still in the stone age."

There’s no way we can say for sure. We can’t rely on the current administration.

"Today I was stood up twice by people who wanted to meet with me to get help with their spiritual life. I saw both of them on Facebook as I was waiting on them to show up. A couple that wanted help with their marriage was supposed to meet with me today, but they had something come up. Sure, these can probably be explained, but it does make you wonder about our priorities. The Bible says to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and then all else will be added to it. Somehow we think that we need to get everything else in order and then find time for God."

"MacDonald evokes the “ingroup bunker mentality” as “a fundamental characteristic of Jewish society.” So it was, and perhaps still is among many older Jews. But to fail to limn why it’s so for exogenous and millennia-long reasons, and how it parallels the same mentality in other middleman minorities, can only be seen as a telling omission. This is even more bizarre when Thomas Sowell has already done the intellectual heavy lifting, e.g. here."

"I understand why this movie isn’t well received. It’s schlock. The plot, the characters, everything about it is just low-grade thriller. And I don’t really love it for that; the acting included. As much as I like Nicholas Cage, and the role he played in moving action heroes away from the Stallones and the Van Dammes (which was a positive in my opinion), he really does feel samey in many of his movies. This movie is no exception, and apart from being a zany actor for a odd-ball role, I can’t really see any other reason to have him as the star. I would have picked another actor for this one, not sure which one but not Cage. Yeah, I understand he was made for these kind of parts, but meh. He doesn’t really seem to have any chemistry with the romance and Biel. Speaking of Biel, I don’t think I really like her as an actress. Yeah, she’s gorgeous, but you need more than that to be a compelling character, and she certainly does not bring it here. The character is one-dimensional and forgettable, and I’m sorry but Biel just relies too much on looks and not enough on an ability to act in my opinion. As for Julianne Moore, I don’t want you to think that I have something against her for this and the Blindness article but I don’t think she is good in this. Not because of her really, it seems like she was just not a good fit for this movie. I’m actually a bit surprised to see her in it to be honest. I do like her, just not in what I have talked about thus far."

You'd come home as though it had been raining, even though there had been no evidence of precipitation in the rain gauge outside the town hall."

"I turn now to 2 Timothy 4:16, 17. “At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me . . .Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me.” There is one of those “But God’s.” He knew from whence his help would come."

If the characters prevent it from hiding back in the barrow, it will seek a sheltered spot where it's body can lie undisturbed during the next month, such as the bottom of a deep stream. If it does get back into the barrow it can be killed by lighting a huge fire that covers the entire mound, as this cooks it against the hot stones."

"But more importantly, the paratextual approach can work tremendously well on a creative level. The most obvious example in the Davison era is The Caves of Androzani, Davison’s regeneration story, which gained an entire second level of buildup and suspense from the early announcement in Doctor Who Monthly that it would be written by Robert Holmes, a writer whose reputation the magazine had bolstered in its overviews of past stories. It helped, of course, that the story was phenomenally good and that the build-up to it was actually paid off by what was transmitted, but on the other hand, part of the impact the story had on fandom was undoubtedly the fact that it was built to in the way it was."
"First-time feature director Sean Durkin does not employ the standard flashback to tell Martha’s story. He uses striking transitions to move between the past and present, zooming in on an item only to reveal a change of location and time upon zooming out. The twisted logic that was fed to Martha daily has warped her perception of social norms and acceptable behaviour. Olsen does an excellent job of portraying Martha’s confusion and vulnerability. John Hawkes’ depiction of the cult leader is particularly disturbing as he brainwashes the young people around him into believing the violations of their persons and the criminal behaviour they participate in is “normal.” His interactions with Marth"

"They believed that God would help them, but for now they were in bondage. They were slaves to the Persians still. They had to pay heavy taxes of money and produce, and perhaps even military service. The deliverance prophecies of Jeremiah were not for them. This caused them great distress, but it was in this state of affairs that they had a strong faith in God and sought after him, no matter what happened. Now, remembering the faithfulness of God previously in the covenants, they would write up a covenant that they might obey God."

"Are passive sign-ups a good idea? It seems so easy and convenient to bring people into the fold in this way. You’ve got something they want – a free download, a product trial, etc – and they opt into your newsletter as a way to get a great deal. Most people don’t think too much about giving out their email address, even knowing they are signing up for promotional offers. The trick here is not to collect email addresses but rather to attract the type of person who would appreciate your newsletter. Passive sign-ups are usually only a good idea if what you have to offer via your newsletter is similar to what motivated the sign-up in the first place."
"Hello to everyone. I can't believe it is less than a month now til Christmas. I think it is really important in this crazy time of year to stop and pause for a minute and see what God has done this year in our lives. We started the year with high hopes of one of the best years of our lives, so many great things were going to happen this year.....well, they just didn't. The highlights though have been great.....the arrival of our granddaughter Alexia Laine, and some relationships restored that had been a long time broken. As for the rest if you can scroll through the blogs and get a bit of an idea."

Not surprised of course, they was using a style named ""Gesture"" I was know that but I wasn't know what gesture for. At the begining; I didn't need something like that. But now I'm thinking it's the only way to reach exactly what I need. I started to search and study about it by monday. I wasn't able to draw gesture drawing so it didn't work for me but I believe it will!"
"People may think of the Fourth of July as sitting back with a nice cold beer, and a chance to relax and visit with family. Even though I get excited about these things also, I really think of those who are serving, and have served, in order for us to have a drink and share the holiday together."
The British Imperialism in the region was simply the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back. There were other pressing matters such as the constant border wars & growing land shortages. The notable consequence relating to the abolition of slavery which might have in fact played a role in causing the Great Trek was that the former slaves were now wandering all over often attacking local residents. Piet Retief only mentioned the abolition of slavery in his Manifesto in a vain attempt at getting the tacit support or understanding of the slave owning Cape Dutch. Who in fact often looked down at the Boers & ridiculed them for wanting to trek.

"Warren’s life was filled with music, being taught at an early age by his father, then attending New York Military Academy majoring in music. He was a trombonist with his brother’s band, Les Brown and the Band of Renown until he went into the Navy in World War II where he served for 3 years. Upon discharge, he entered the business end of music and joined Leeds Music in New York City. Because of his success as a “song plugger” finding hit songs for many artists and overseeing many educational projects for Leeds, he was transferred to California to open and head the Leeds Music office there. The company sold to MCA and Warren served as Vice President of MCA Music, Inc., later to become Universal Music, until his retirement in 1981. During his tenure, he found Strangers In the Night for Frank Sinatra, Girl from Ipanema for Antonio Carlos Jobin, and helped market in the USA the innovative music album Jesus Christ Super Star, Downtown by Petula Clark, and It’s Not Unusual by Tom Jones."

"The first surprise to me was the airport is adjacent to the main strip. Most cities are built first and then they had to squeeze in an airport somewhere outside of the city. Given the Las Vegas location in the middle of nowhere in the desert, there was plenty of space for an airport. Airport itself is ordinary, but I wanted to stay in the baggage claim area of airport and just people watch! What a diversity of people congregating here. There was a man and his son wearing slick cowboy hats and they had a special hat case carrier . I reminded myself i was in the southwest now, not northeast, where cowboy hats are haute couture. But, lo and behold! There are a couple of Staten Island guys sporting the gelled and sprayed ""Jersey Shore"" hair and talking on their cell phones. (Note: I did see a Snookie lookalike at one of the hotels) There were Europeans and American families, each can be distinguished by their fashion sense."

At lunch, they pick out their own meals, which all schools give free, and carry the trays to lunch tables. There is no Internet filter in the school library. They can walk in their socks during class, but at home even the very young are expected to lace up their own skates or put on their own skis."

"When we read Proverbs 31, we need to remember to jump ahead to the New Testament. Jesus - not a list of rules – makes a woman into a Proverbs 31 woman. He takes a controlling woman and teaches her to put others before themselves. He indwells the lazy woman and provides her with purpose and perseverance. He gives her the mind of Christ and instills wisdom in her over time. He breathes warmth into her cold heart and helps her become compassionate. He gives her strength in her weakness. He gives her dignity in her shame. The real Proverbs 31 woman is simply a Jesus woman."

"We could see the hotel where the wedding would be from the ferry. It was a very fancy hotel with a beautiful view of the city from huge wrap-around windows, with flowers everywhere, paper lanterns hanging from the high ceilings . . . That's a big difference with French weddings, they tend to be in small village halls here. Though I suppose in bigger cities ballrooms in hotels might be common. Restaurants are common here too, for smaller groups. Out where I live, it's usually in the multipurpose room across the square from the town hall. I feel like in the states, the venue is extremely important. Tons of flowers in lush interiors, urban lofts with ice sculptures, lights galore in a marquee in the woods. Here, the food seems to take center stage, in functional rooms with tile floors and nice but not overly ambitious decorations. And really, all of this could be regional. I have been to a wedding at a chateau, which was lovely, but there aren't tons of chateaux in the area, so maybe other more chateau-y regions have nicer reception halls. And I'll bet people who live closer to the beach in France use it for weddings. At least, I hope they do!"

"Today Junior Seau left before any of us were ready to let him leave. By all accounts Seau was a model NFL citizen. He was the consummate professional on the field and a charitable and philanthropic presence in the community off of it. But in the last years of his life he began to show the signs of instability just as he fallen brethren had. And so our final memory of him won’t be of his passion, his steely gaze as he sized up the unfortunate running back or receiver who crossed his path; it will be of an idol, alone with a pain he couldn’t share or defeat. It is maddeningly ironic that Seau’s death comes on the same day that 4 current and former New Orleans Saints players received their punishments for their roles in a bounty program designed to target and injure specific members of the opposition, injuries that could lead to the same outcome that befell Junior Seau."

"This is what God tells us in His Word – that God saved us and called us with a holy calling given us in Christ before the world began. This life on earth here is not a “contest” to see “what will happen” as the result of God creating man. Rather, it was decided by God before the world began. Moreover, we were there as God’s elect when this was “decided”. This was given us in Christ, as God’s elect, before the world began. I will go in to some scripture on that, but want to cut “right to the chase”. We see in this scripture that the purpose of this creation is centered in Jesus Christ before the world began. What will Jesus accomplish for us?? Through Jesus Christ, God will save us and call us (not according to our own works) but according to God’s own eternal counsel — His own purpose and grace before the world began. This, of course, is speaking of predestination being God working out His own plan towards His elect in grace. Yet, the scripture tells us more. The scripture tells us that this manifestation of our salvation and holy calling is manifested by the appearing of our Savior. Also, that Jesus Christ appearing abolishes death and brings life and immortality to light through the gospel. God’s purpose and grace is to save us by abolishing (destroying into nonexistence)… death… and “giving us beauty for ashes” as some say. These human bodies were made from the dust of the ground. And we know that at the Lord’s return, this mortality will put on immortality. We will gain new Heavenly spiritual bodies. We who are the elect, those called out and saved in this life, will put off this earthly tabernacle and put on the Heavenly tabernacle. We will experience the full redemption in our bodies in gaining new Heavenly spiritual bodies at the Lord’s return."

"But to weigh the benefits or demerits of James Q. Wilson’s theory should be easier. Chad Freidrichs’s marvelous documentary The Pruitt Igoe Myth (2011) brings out the core problem brilliantly. While the St. Louis housing project has become notorious as a symbol of many things—the hopelessness of public housing, the failure of liberal efforts to help the poor, and, above all, the pathology of the poor themselves—the film reveals a forgotten history. Some former residents were forever scarred by their violent experiences at Pruitt-Igoe, but others looked back on the place with great fondness. Pruitt-Igoe was a step up for many of the former slum dwellers, who had left deep poverty in the South for dangerous, cramped conditions in the city. In the beginning, the projects were a sparkling mirage of upward mobility for poor families who had never had proper plumbing or electricity. It was the “poor man’s penthouse,” as one resident declared."

I still think the job of a journalist is so meaningful that it is worth my devotion.”"
"If you know the editor well, you can be a bit chatty - ask after their children/holiday/health. Don't give a run-down of all the problems in your life even if you do know the editor well. It's not professional. What you should do, though, is alert the editor to any forthcoming events that will mean you're out of contact if they have any problems with the file or the book. So 'please check that you can open the file, as I won't be around for the next couple of days to resend it' is fine. Or 'I'm going to Borneo for three weeks next Wednesday so I'll be out of contact...' This is helpful information - if you don't tell them, you might hold up production of your book by several weeks and that won't be popular."

Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child also recognizes the contribution breastfeeding makes to the fulfilment of the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of health."

"After a week of classes, I have a few observations about going to school here. Who knows if these will pan out for the rest of the semester, but here’s what I’ve noticed thus far. First, being on a semester system rather than a quarter system, everything seems to move more slowly. Back at UW, I would already be thinking about my first midterms. Here, with 15 weeks of class, things don’t seem as rushed. Second, perhaps the professors are accustomed to Moroccan students who know English as a third or even fourth language. I say this because the amount of reading assigned for class in general is less than I would get in my classes at UW. From talking to other Moroccan students, it takes them much longer to read the same section of a textbook, simply due to the fact that I am a native English speaker and they are not. Due to these two trends, I think I’m going to have more free time than I would back home. I’m excited because this should give me the chance to join some clubs (Guitar Club, DJ Club, Explorer’s Club, maybe even Extreme Sports Club) and also tryout for the basketball, tennis, and ping pong (awesome!) teams."

As a result, we’re known for thinking sex is shameful."
"And that's something else: for a director and visualiser like Bakshi to create figures that are so plain and dull, so poorly conceptualized and so sloppily executed is not in keeping with the more solid, substantial elements onscreen. Meaning?

"If you are a local performer the best way to get your face familiarized is to attend one of the shows you hope to be booked in. Stay for the show and approach the producer afterwards, introduce yourself and express your interest in performing there. Follow up with an email and send video clips and descriptions of your act (I will go into this in more detail later). When a performer introduces themselves to me in person, it helps solidify who they are to me in my mind among a sea of faceless emails and complicated burlesque names. It also helps me to know that the performer already knows what the venue and the venue's clientele are like, and more importantly, what type of acts are booked and what type of stage (or lack of) she will be dealing with."
"To conclude, Glasman has a good grasp of what is wrong with England. He has a comprehensive understanding of the realities and consequences of a lack of political representation and the subjugation of discussion about the English question. However, whilst we should be grateful for, and take up with vigour any opportunity to engage with the political hierarchy about the necessity of freedom and fairness for England, I struggle to see how these ends can be achieved through the medium of political parties that seek only re-election and mandates of vacuous ‘change’ above anything meaningful."

Since writing about a hedge witch – or green witch – I’ve learned a lot more about this holiday."
"There has been something of a fightback from the traditional industry. They seem to have consolidated their investment around a highly focussed strategy where they spend a year building up to one big album release – like we saw with Lana Del Rey this year – while pretty much ignoring the rest of their catalogues. This is pretty clever, and it does seem to work, but it has had a bit of chilling effect on the explosion in alternatives that we saw a few years back. It’s increasingly hard for artists who aren’t interested in hoop jumping to break through to public exposure. So many magazines are only kept afloat by advertising from the industry they ‘criticize’ that they just retreat to trawling back catalogues for cover stars and saving up all their bile for people who aren’t subsidizing their lifestyles. Bookers can demand that festivals take their dull acts on Sunday afternoon as a condition of supplying their highly publicised headliners for Saturday night – effectively barring the way for better bands."

The second song for example, On The Run, although its not really what I would call a song, I never skip it, it makes the whole album sort of bind together, it tells part of the story like a stroke of genius."
Pastry Cream:
"When compulsive consumers-cum-critics praise this or that modern piece of referential art, they're pretending that they're spending a lot of time with it and that this is a testament to the quality of the material (they're making a claim then, of the art being essential, as explained above). Do not trust them, divide their claims of how much they've experienced the object of art by ten or more. If they say they've been listening to a record for two months straight, this means they've given it a half-dozen incomplete listens while surfing the internet, perhaps. The reason they're lying is because they know nobody will pay any attention to their recommendations if they were truthful about how they're using the product. Art is still sold on the basis of essentialism even when both critic and consumer do not consume the product with mind to its essential quality. The merit of art has been sidestepped, it has become at best a selling point on a marketing sheet. What is sold and bought instead, is a brief feeling of elation, belonging, an experience of something one already is prepared to experience."

"After giving up the 1 unearned run in the first, Hong pitched marvelously and to the delight of the firecracker throwing fans had a 1 hitter going into the 6th inning. He was wild though and had put 2 Senators on the bases after hitting them with pitches. Now taking the mound in the 6th Hong fell victim to the Oaks lousy fielding. A cheap infield single by Cal Lahman followed by Alex Kampouris' hit put runners on first and second. Perhaps unnerved by the developments, Hong then drilled Ray French in the ribs to load the bases with no outs. Kettle Wirts hit an easy double play ball to shortstop Greg Mulleavy but he bobbled it and a run crossed the plate with only one out. Nushida's replacement, pitcher Lefty Vinci slugged a base clearing triple and Hong was taken out of the game. Hong had lasted 5 1/3 innings, gave up 4 hits, walked 4 and got charged with 2 earned runs and was tagged with the loss as the Senators went on to beat Oakland 7 to 5."

"Another good reason is the ability to have more control over your financial decisions in tough times.

You can make the important decisions right there, instead of sitting back and worrying about whether some corporate official knows exactly what’s going on when he decides to cut costs."

"The movement of the ritual, from the centre of the camp, out into the desert, suggests and enacts the movement of impurity. The impurity is removed away from God and his people, and out of the camp. Away from holiness, and purity, out into the neutral desert. Away from order and out into chaos. An eradication of the impurity of transgression is not in view, but rather a removal of impurity from the camp, limiting the effect it can have upon the covenantal relationship."

"The performances in this movie were exactly what they were. First off, all of the bunnies (and mostly EB) were so ridiculously cute in their animation. Women will swoon. I may have swooned myself, but I’m not entirely sure what swooning is. Is that when you pass out and wake up with no pants on and covered in blood that’s not your own? EB himself had occasional moments of funniness, but almost as many occasions of annoyance. I think that’s due to Russell Brand lending his voice to the character. I’ve always felt like Russell Brand’s idea of comedy was to constantly have things coming out of your mouth and then, even if only 10% are funny or worth hearing, at least people will still leave thinking he was hilarious. What didn’t annoy me about EB was that he was a fantastic drummer. Sure, there was no good reason for him to drum in the movie, but he was animated to be good at it. James Marsden was mostly manic and over the top on his side, with a little bit of stupid mixed in, but he never really bothered me. Gary Cole was mostly an asshole through the movie."
"Now the world is imploding because their economies are in failure, I ask you, what did you expect from an illusion? Don't tell me you bought into the fantasy of unlimited growth. If we are living on a finite planet, with finite resources, for a finite period of say eighty or so years, the entire concept of infinity is meaningless. There is only one infinity and that is the infinity of the Creator. The rest is gibberish, a massive con. Something to do while we breathe in, breathe out. Unfortunately it is a con that is woven from potentially indestructible complexities and doomed to persist until everyone is converted or dead or beaten down never to rise again to expose at last the impossibility of existence in any other medium other than that of impossibly infinite growth. All this worsens in the face of climate chaos. Nothing, not even God, stands in the way, in fact, climate payback empowers greater heights of spectacular hustles as if secretly, in the black heart of the pusher, time is of the essence.

Thankfully it all came together. I think I'm alone in the wilderness in my genuine enjoyment of this long misunderstood film, which is really less of a horror film about devil cults and more a MEMENTO-style mediation on religion and righteousness. I only rank it lower than other commentaries I've done because upon listening to it, I have so many ""Um"" and ""Ah"" moments that the Toastmasters would grill me alive; I'm sure that's present on other commentaries I've done, but it just felt especially egregious here. Well, that and I occasionally lose my focus when Ms. Black chooses to take the discussion in another more interesting direction. Ultimately though, a long poortly-treated movie finally gets its due, and I got to help."

The strength of this installment of the game and pretty much the previous games of Mass Effect has always been the story and the universe’s characters. The gravity of the war and its inevitable losses are felt as you play the game. Characters die and their deaths are a sacrifice that need to be made in the hopes all living beings will have a chance at survival. At times you witness your Shepard make a stunning victory against the Reapers and in others you witness your hero/heroine watch as a race’s home world get utterly destroyed right before your Shepard’s eyes and he/she is powerless to stop it. It’s moments like these where playing for the story is truly worth it.

"Such a twisty, turny, curvy one lane primarily road through the Allegheny mountains with some spectacular views, wildflowers through the trees and even a few dogwoods still in bloom this way. BUT, I know there's always a but.....well, it was a road to travel one time. For our RV and towing a car, it was tedious as Jerry adhered to the truck caution signs and drove in low gear at no more than 30 mph on over half the way and being a courteous driver he pulled over frequently to allow vehicles and motor cyclists to pass on the one lane. There were plenty of motorcyclists on the hills and curves enjoying themselves. The road made us deeply appreciate those hearty stalwart early colonial settlers of Penn's Woods back in the early days of 1700""s and later. That anyone ventured and successfully arrived at Ft. Pitt (today's Pittsburgh) on the western side of the state through the mountains, the weather and the Indians at that time,explains a lot about the attitude of western Pennsylvanians. The eastern elite (Philadelphians) considered the westerners riff raff, not as polished, not as distinguished as the ones who remained on the eastern side. There is some truth because many of the early settlers were thieves, criminal element, etc. It was their ticket to freedom to settle the country and they took it. That roughness helped them persevere over trials on trails. All these years down through history some of that attitude prevails between the eastern and western state residents. We westerners are more the rowdies, they say."

"As all Cat Fans know, Selina made her debut way back in Batman #1 as an uncostumed jewel thief known as The Cat. She was modeled after sex-goddess of the day, Hedy Lamarr, looked smashing in an evening gown, and the first thing Batman noticed was her very shapely legs. Her first “costume”consisted only of a full face furry cat-mask, which wasn’t exactly flattering."

"In the first year alone, the note will require an $80,000 principal payment plus $24,000 worth of interest (6% of $400,000). To meet the principal payment alone, the company would need to generate $123,077 in pre-tax earnings in order to net $80,000 after tax. Adding in the $24,000 in interest, the company would need to generate $147,077 in pre-tax earnings in the first year. Given an average net margin of 5%, the company would need to generate $2,941,538 in new sales in order to make the first year’s principal and interest payment to the deceased’s estate. How likely is it for such a small company to generate $2.9 million in new sales in the year following the death of a key employee/shareholder?"

"So if the root canal wasn't enough financial stress, some boat gear is acting up. The hydraulic cylinder that controls the tension in some rigging that holds the mast up started leaking around the seal. I did some research and also with some advice from an acquaintance that runs a sailboat rigging company, I found that ""sure, any hydraulic shop can overhaul them. They just use standard seals"". So I took the cylinder to the only local hydraulic shop for overhaul. They said that they could get on it in a few days, but after eight days I called them on Thursday. They said that they would get on it that afternoon. That afternoon I got a call. They could not get it apart. The threads have galled. So with a race pending next weekend, I retrieved it and reinstalled it on the boat tonight. Hopefully it won't leak to much. After the race, I will probably send it to a ""Authorized repair facility"". And if they can't repair it, then I will price out a new one, OUCH!"

"iloveRobots is a leading developer of interactive play experiences for children, using today’s most innovative technologies. Though our products debuted in 2009, we got our start more than a decade earlier, building high-tech mobile machines at Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. What entranced us more than robots’ ability to do tasks, however, was their power to inspire intelligent engagement and emotional exploration. We experimented with using what we’d learned in the lab to transform everyday experiences. The result? Robotic toys for kids that actually adapt to each interaction and grow as kids grow, taking playtime from fun to magical."

"Pertwee was educated at Frensham Heights School, an independent school in Rowledge, near Farnham in Surrey, at Sherborne School in Sherborne in Dorset, and at some other schools from which he was expelled. After school, he went to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), from which he was also expelled after he refused to play a Greek ""wind"" during one of the lessons, feeling it was a waste of both his time and his father's money. He was also accused of writing graffiti about the tutors on the toilet walls. Pertwee was an officer in the Royal Navy, spending some time working in naval intelligence during the Second World War. He was a crew member of HMS Hood and was transferred off the ship shortly before she was sunk, losing all but three men. During his time in the Navy Pertwee woke up one morning after a drunken night out while in port to find a tattoo on his right arm, which was occasionally seen during his time in Doctor Who. After the war he made a name for himself as a comedy actor, notably on radio in Waterlogged Spa, alongside Eric Barker and Puffney Post Office in which he played a hapless old postman with the catch-phrase ""It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you tears them up"". From 1959 to 1977, he had a long-running role as the conniving Chief Petty Officer Pertwee in The Navy Lark on BBC Radio. He was known as a Danny Kaye look-alike, and his impersonation of Kaye can be seen in the 1949 film Murder at the Windmill. On stage, he played the part of Lycus in the 1963 London production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum with Frankie Howerd and appeared in the smaller role of Crassus in the 1966 film version. He appeared as Sidney Tait in the 1963 comedy Ladies Who Do and later in four Carry On films: Carry On Cleo (1964, as the soothsayer), Carry On Screaming (1966, as Dr. Fettle), Carry On Cowboy (1965, as Sheriff Earp) and Carry On Columbus (1992, as the Duke of Costa Brava). On television, he started off with small parts in children's shows like Mr Pastry. Later he made an appearance in The Avengers episode ""From Venus with Love"" as Brigadier Whitehead, and in the 1970s, he guest-starred as a vicar in The Goodies' episode ""Wacky Wales"". He had one of his most memorable film roles in the 1971 Amicus horror compendium The House That Dripped Blood. Filmed in the summer of 1970, between his first and second Doctor Who seasons, Pertwee played the lead in the last segment of the film as Paul Henderson, a deliciously arrogant horror film star who meets his quasi-comedic doom thanks to a genuine vampire cloak."""

"The fist group tend to be women of low intelligence and generally low self esteem, it is this group, who seem to believe that their bodies are all they have to offer, and that a woman's highest ambition is to become pregnant and get a council flat.

Instead, my job is to work with them to recognize the principles that we all want to live by, principles of trust, respect, honor, legality, and good manners. My job is to support them, to listen, to be available, and, yes, to arrange transportation. My job is to offer resources and time and nuggets and—rarely—a shoulder when one of them discovers she's made a bad choice."

"On Saturday I got dragged into irresponsible and uncontrolled pub based environments where socially irresponsible landlords want to sell you as much beer as possible due to a lack of social conscience driven by the profit imperative. Pubs are irresponsible places. There are rules in pubs. Rules about drinking in rounds, standing your round and matching your mates pint for pint, drink for drink. You can’t opt out with a soft drink, to do so makes you a puff. You have to get smashed; it’s like the law or something. Pub landlords are happy to serve you, regardless of how smashed you get, and if you find yourself in an incapable state then it’s all the fault of Tesco as the incorrect assumption is made that you were drinking before you went out. No one in their right mind would drink before meeting up with my pals. Actually no one in their right mind would drink with them full stop, but that's the way men make friends. You meet some people at school and university and these people become your friends and stay your friends regardless of whether you still have anything in common now you're all grown up. We don't really make friends as adults as we don't really want any, as the initial requirement based on childish insecurity no longer exists."

"As mobile networks have evolved, so have the phones that work on those networks. Given the complexity of spectrum allocation plans in countries around the world and the high cost of spectrum, wireless providers have been forced to acquire spectrum where it was available rather than where it was best suited to their needs. When a provider network utilized only one set of frequencies, single band phones were acceptable. Each new set of frequencies acquired by the providers required that the phones be able to operate on the new frequencies in addition to the old frequencies. Consequently, over the past fifteen years, handsets have evolved from single band through dual band and tri band phones to the quad and penta band phones of today. Some of the biggest providers in the world today are already planning for a future with 10-band and 11-band phones."

"When there are scandals and when someone is caught red handed many will respond with self-righteousness and indignance or worse (as Roxy has hinted) the unscathed will still seek vengeance like an angry mob. The concerns of those scammed are legitimate and they should be handled by professionals and authorities. For those of us who are mere spectators dealing with the aftershock, why not seize this moment for contemplation and self-critique? After all much like the ideology of consumerism, self righteousness can be a hell of a drug."

Every wrong decision I have made, every mistake I’ve made, it all leads up to this point: how does all this affect the rest of my life? Am I less of a person than I was before anyone knew about my struggles? Or am I more of a person now that I’m being honest?"

"Sexual abuse against a child is one aspect of this story, but it is not the only one. Because while this abuse was sexual, and against a child, it speaks to the larger of problem of abuse as a whole within our society. It speaks of the disrespectful, demeaning, and dehumanizing behavior we see in so many aspects of our lives. It speaks of the way so many of us have decided that abuse such as this, in many guises and many situations, is okay. We hold children to a higher standard than we hold ourselves, through coercion and manipulation. We hit kids in the name of teaching them lessons and responsibility. We distance ourselves emotionally from our children through belittling them and prioritizing our needs and wants over theirs. And we tell them that we do it all out of love."

"- “The figurative language of the prophets is taken from the analogy between the world natural and an empire or kingdom considered as a world politic. Accordingly, the world natural, consisting of heaven and earth, signifies the whole world politic, consisting of thrones and people, or so much of it as is considered in prophecy; and the things in that world signify the analogous things in this. For the heavens and the things therein signify thrones and dignities, and those who enjoy them: and the earth, with the things thereon, the inferior people; and the lowest parts of the earth, called Hades or Hell, the lowest or most miserable part of them. Great earthquakes, and the shaking of heaven and earth, are put for the shaking of kingdoms, so as to distract and overthrow them; the creating of a new heaven and earth, and the passing of an old one; or the beginning and end of a world, for the rise and ruin of a body politic signified thereby. The sun, for the whole species and race of kings, in the kingdoms of the world politic; the moon, for the body of common people considered as the king’s wife; the starts, for subordinate princes and great men; or for bishops and rulers of the people of God, when the sun is Christ. Setting of the sun, moon, and stars; darkening the sun, turning the moon into blood, and falling of the stars, for the ceasing of a kingdom.”"

Pricey some would argue for what is essentially 4 x40g portions, however, most of the ingredients would be hard to find in a supermarket (lemon infused sultanas anyone?!) and from a health shop it would probably cost you that much to walk through the door! For me, prior to losing weight, I think on average I would spend at least £5 per weekend on junk, and that would just be weekends. I never realised before, but junk is costly! For me, Graze works out cheaper than the way I was living previously, and it is a real treat to come home to on a Wednesday evening. Plus the separation of the 4 punnets means you could take one to work each day (unless you find them too irresistible and scoff them all at once – it is easily done!)"
"The human trafficking unit has laid more than 80 criminal charges, including against Styles-Lyons, since its inception."
"Russell’s spiritual others loudly dispute their concerns: “You comprehend, young man, that our energy will dissipate slowly into the mortal realm,” said an elderly man. Another responds: “It’s monotonous here, let’s do this; it would take years for the mortal’s atmosphere to harm us. That’s a wimpy excuse.” A woman’s voice speaks out: “No, they can take care of themselves.” Another voice says: “Being reborn’s our first obligation.” The first voice speaks out again: “If they fight us, we could possibly terminate.” An elderly gruff voice booms out: “Make a deal. Do this and then be reborn.” Woman’s voice: “That’s a gamble, also.” Elderly man replies: “Just want to hang out here and watch second hand adventures?” Russell grins, “Yeah…, right. I prefer you all just quietly watch. I know capable mortals who’ll help me. You know them. They won’t get upset at the sight of me and you know I’ll dodge anything hazardous. Finding these spirits will be easy. This is my assignment. I’ll agree to discuss rebirth after we return.” He pauses and the deep crease across his forehead relaxes and smoothes out; his mouth breaks into a wide grin. He settles down and nods toward his monitor. “We’ll go. I loved working on Missing Person cases when I was a mortal Detective.”"
"Manchester United slipped up against Everton at Old Trafford after twice taking the lead and are now just three points ahead of the Citizens, who have a far superior goal difference. A win for Roberto Mancini’s side will see them move to the top of the table, while either a draw or a loss will see the Red Devils take a huge step towards retaining their Premier League crown."

"We continued down the river and had five or so additional crocs put on a show for us. The last croc, that was named Bogart, was the oldest (about 70 years old) and the biggest, and even though he was missing three of his four limbs, he still came up out of the water to get his lunch. Obviously, these crocs have learned the routine for eating every day."
"By the time I got closer to the stage area J.Pinder was on deck rocking cuts off his Careless project. Pinder performed a very tight and solid set so I stepped to his table, bought a tee-shirt from him directly and took a few photos of the cool brotha. I missed out on Ad.D’s set since they rocked first, while I was out in the rain holding a wet joint, lol…Thx to Edot from T-Dot."

"So where, along the way, did it become acceptable for fans of one lot of eleven people who kick a ball to mock the tragedies of another?"
"Talking of mean, I mean…why didn’t the photographer have the heart to tell me that grape really isn’t ‘my’ colour and that pouchy pockets on a blouse isn’t a great look on the well-endowed and that what I thought were nice jeans look like jodhpurs? And that skinny jeans really should be tucked into boots, not dragged over them. Men, huh?"
"In fact, the introduction of “racism” might sometimes introduce a complicating factor. Stabbing someone constitutes violent physical discrimination in any case. The automatic assumption of “racism” can easily be a false trail. So while offensive language might be a useful guide as to whether a crime was racially motivated, it should, in my opinion, be seen as one of a number of factors, to be corroborated before any final conclusion can be drawn."

"Although the ""dogmatic disbelief"" of these intellectuals remained ""intolerable,"" the religious tenets of his own lukewarm Protestant faith were equally unsatisfactory. Eventually his insecurely held faith, a remnant of childhood, ""just dropped away… as easily as a child loses a first tooth."" By the winter of 1893, he was an avowed agnostic, ceasing all church attendance and declaring to friends that he ""didn't believe in a Christian faith."" This was his state of heart and mind when, in 1897, he first made the acquaintance of Belloc."

"Growing these plants is one of the most space and work efficient ways to grow your own food. Although the mounds require quite a bit of space between them, growing several plants per mound means more plants overall. The lower space in between often acts as swales or berms in which the water collects and soaks into the ground. I'm growing them in a hex pattern this year, in an attempt to fit as many mounds into my small garden as possible. We'll see how it works."

"Burke also hints at the fact that if ‘six million Muslims of France’ were really radicalised – then France would certainly know about it. Is it really that simple? The population of France is still, I think, around sixty million. It also has an army, a strong police force, a security service and all the rest. Taking into account all these things, even a sizable minority of six million Muslims would still think twice about an overwhelming show of force against the French Government or against the millions of non-Muslim French citizens. Radical Islamists know that because there are no mountains to hide in, as there are in Pakistan and Afghanistan, an overwhelming or systematic attack on the French Government, or the French people, would be pretty unwise, to say the least. It would quite simply be crushed. Thus small acts of terrorism and the rest is all the Islamists have to go on in France and indeed in the UK. Anything more than that would simply backfire. So what is Burke expecting these radicalised Muslims to do (even if we take them to be radicalised)? Even one million radicalised Muslims would not be foolish enough to take on a centralised government, with its army, police, etc. and a country of sixty million people. And, as I argued before, it could be the case that there is a million radicalised Muslims in France (or England), but even then only a few thousand or so would be actively radical."

"The land grab for agriculture for corporates have another drawback. Suppose that they buy the land today for farming but later turn it into a real estate project, could they be challenged. The contract would say that they brought the land and are landowners and could do anything with it. Forgive me if the words come out strong but that would be an exact replica of colonial time (which we as nation tried to forgo in our independence struggle), by using terms like modernizing and upliftment as proxy to get the job done. One feels the approach is not right. There needs to be a policy which needs to be planned where the local population which is living there does not feel thrown out, by being arm twisted on the bases of using various exploitative laws."

"Everything was done as usual. The pack of cards was an old one. The cards were shuffled, cut and dealt as normal... ""We play regularly and are always very careful to make sure the deck of cards is shuffled repeatedly. I don't mean to sound churlish here, because they surely deserve their moment of fun and fame, but mathematically every other set of hands they were dealt that night would have had the same probability of occurring.

"Hell, even if you're not in a couple, it may take a few tries before you get it right. Go out too much, and you stop sleeping. You're overstimulated to the point where everything is boring, you've tried every restaurant and every bar, you've seen God knows how many bands, and they all kind of fade into the same neon-lit horizon. Your culture knowledge does become staggering -- I know people who are little walking encyclopedias of indie bands, sleeper films, and hidden food trailers -- but it gets harder to hear yourself think."

We met his wife at the hospital and headed up to see Shaun. Although being somewhat uncomfortable, he seemed ok, still not really with it, but much improved."
"The second half of the show was dedicated to vintage evening dresses and gorgeous, daring lingerie. The only way to describe the underwear (from La Perla, Lascivious and Princesse tam.tam) is decadent and sexy – a parade of black lace and navy satin. The models looked stunning and walked with confidence, helped in part to their gravity-defying ‘dos from Artizan, and while most of the lingerie featured was out of my budget, if it came with a washboard stomach and curves in all the right places, I’d definitely be buying! : ) The vintage dresses included a mix of short 60s shift dresses and longer numbers, like the white 70s Grecian feather dress that floated down the catwalk."

And once all my stuff is IN the basement, I abandon it to stand out in the front yard until I’m bound to be swept away like Jonas’s truck in Twister. I know I can get into the basement fast, but it takes a little prep time to gather the items that mean the most to me. The pack has changed throughout the years based what’s important to me at that juncture of my life. SO here are my survival packs throughout the years:"

"Are nurse managers doing the best they can when it comes to hiring new staff? I suspect not all would answer in the affirmative. The next question is are all prospective nursing employees portraying their skills and experience accurately? When new nursing staff join any particular area of a hospital they become the focus of attention. A new face, a new name that is essentially unknown amongst the already present staff. Reality dictates that several judgments are being made early in this introduction. For the new nurse that is joining the group there is a lot of trepidation about learning the ropes and fitting in. The biggest hurdle that new nurses have to negotiate is the perceptions that are developed about them by the already present staff."

"Power was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1914, the only son of Helen Emma ""Patia"" (née Reaume) and the English-born American stage and screen actor Tyrone Power, Sr. Power was descended from a long theatrical line going back to his great-grandfather, the actor and comedian Tyrone Power (1795-1841). His father's ancestry included Irish, English, and Protestant French Huguenots (the latter through his paternal grandmother's Lavenu and Blossett ancestors). His mother had Catholic French Canadian (through the Reaume family) and German (from Alsace-Lorraine) ancestry. Through his paternal great-grandmother, Anne Gilbert, Power was related to the actor Laurence Olivier; through his paternal grandmother, stage actress Ethel Lavenu, he was related by marriage to author Evelyn Waugh, and through his father's first cousin, Norah Emily Gorman Power, he was related to the theatrical director Sir (William) Tyrone Guthrie, founder of the Stratford Festival (now the Stratford Shakespeare Festival) in Canada and the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota."

"I tried living my life without this sport and I can’t do it. It’s too ingrained into my muscle memory and my heart. No other workout provides the same level of full-body involvement for the duration of the exercise. It’s such a challenging, rewarding, and thrilling sport that taps into the dancer and artist in me. But it also is the only kind of exercise I’ve ever experienced that is so fun that I don’t think about the fact that I’m exercising; I’m only focused on trying to do the spins, jumps, or edge moves that I want to be able to do. I can’t encourage people enough to give it a real try. It’s so fun. When the cool air whooshes past my face as I skate around the rink, I feel exhilarated and joyful. Yesterday was my first day back on the ice in a month due to a sprained foot and being back felt so good that I had a really stupid big grin on my face the whole time."

"Considered solely for the romance between Thornton and Margaret Hale, you might say it’s a more serious version of Pride and Prejudice insofar as we watch through the heroine’s eyes as she hates him at first sight and reluctantly but completely changes her mind throughout the course of the show. It’s not an easy sell. I’ve seen the series about 12 times and each time Thornton’s early brutality, as well as his strange subsequent self-revelations about his family’s past, make him an oddly moody brute of a man."

The other conspicuous absences in my childhood were cookbooks. Indian recipes, as is well known, are usually passed down as oral traditions, or on scribbled bits of papers. Even today, I rarely see mum referring to a cookbook. She actually gets amused when I try and pin down quantities so I can write them up for the blog. Her usual method of explanation goes along the lines of 'well, add a handful of this and a pinch of that, and a spoon of this and a couple glugs on that'. Yep, helpful. Not! On ocasion I saw mum using a recipe that was found in a local weekly paper. But we never had those glossy coffee table style cookbooks that everybody seems to own now.

It is then, that it hits me. Some people have kids to complete their families. Or to start a boy band they can sell into indentured servitude on the Disney Channel. I had them for material. Seriously? It’s a little hard to believe Letterman and Leno need a team of writers. Then again, they are rich and famous and I’m not. So they probably know something I don’t. However, if you have kids and you can’t laugh, you’re spending too much time on your iPod, iPad, or iHaveSoMuchToDoICan’tHearAWordYou’reSaying.

While it’s clear from the beginning (there’s even a proposal of marriage met with the fact that Philip isn’t proper – not that Cleone doesn’t love him), that Philip and Cleone are in love and what not – there is a rival. This rival, Bancroft, represents the ‘change’ that Philip must undergo to have Cleone – hopefully – realize he is fit to marry.
How do I decide which of the conflicting imperatives is more important? People don’t like this idea, because they don’t understand it: They think it is immoral to give priority to the defense of the citizens of your state over the protection of the lives of the neighbors of the terrorists. They don’t understand that the world is built in such a way that responsibility is divided.

A brief synopsis. I'd just divorced. I was single, alone, my daughter in my ex's questionable care. I was lonely, scared, unsure. So, I seized the outstretched hand of a friend who lived about 120 miles south, in Baton Rouge. He was single, intelligent, creative, and a good friend to help you forget about your woes. I spent several months of weekends driving down to Baton Rouge to stay with this friend, travel around, ride bikes all over town and country, tour the USS Kidd which he was a tour guide on, and in general try and fail miserably and repeatedly to pick up girls.

A few hours after I watched “Mirror Mirror” someone asked me what I thought of it and my response was “Snow White was a little hottie!”, and I must admit I was quite taken with newcomer Lily Collins. Collins is very charismatic and gives a nice performance as Snow White. She’s sweet and lovable and you can understand why the Prince falls for her and the Queen loathes her. Even one of the dwarfs quickly develops a strong attraction to her (the other dwarfs obviously love her, too, but not in the same way). Collins, the daughter of Genesis drummer and vocalist Phil Collins, shines bright in the movie and will no doubt be a star to watch over the next few years.
There's no particular reason you should know Davis, but if you know my work on moonshine, you've felt his touch.

"I was looking at the new Kindle Fire which looks cool because you can download books and movies and music and it's in color and it seems fairly reasonable in price. But just this morning I read an article that said it works best with Amazon Prime, a $79-a-year subscription that gives you easy access to all those movies, books and music. And all of a sudden, it doesn't seem so reasonable anymore. Granted, $79 a year factors out to about $7 a month, which is a cheap price, but I already have a Netflix subscription for movies, basic cable (about 20 channels) for TV shows, not to mention those hundreds and thousands of books. Do I need to add all of this extra content? No. Not really. But again, I could use the fun money fund and afford to get both the Kindle and a one-year subscription to Amazon Prime and it would be no skin off my nose (it was all gifted money), I'm just not sure I should. (And to clarify: all of my other funds take care of bills and things, this really is just ""fun"" money.) I could of course forgo the Prime and just use the Kindle to download the free classics but that takes some of the fun away from it I think, which is the whole point of the fund."

"The base is some gorgeous Bazzill from their 'Wedding' collection - it has a soft sheen like satin and has a very soft stripe through it. Then I topped it with some silver card. I used some foam tape to pop the whole square layer on top of that - a layer of Sage Shadow and some more Bazzill from the 'Wedding' collection - this time it still has that soft sheen, but it is covered in embossed butterflies!! Around this layer I've added some 1 inch white grosgrain ribbon, some sage satin ribbon and then this gorgeous sage and white rose braid that matched perfectly!! Then I tied some white organza ribbon into a bow and added some silver cord and a white rose bud. The main panel I stamped using the Just Rite Stampers - the Brayton Font and the Rectangular Block - in black ink. The '&' is from SU's 'Together Forever' set and stamped in Sage Shadow. (Thanks HEAPS to my BFF Edna who let me borrow her set!) It was cut out using the Label 1 Nestabilities dies and then it was glued to some Sage Shadow card and I hand cut a fine edge around it.

We can't even envision the ""homeland"" of which the author of Hebrews 11 speaks without having been given the category by living in, and being removed from, a homeland on earth. The ""place"" of our life awakens in us the desire for its fulfillment. Our ""place"" teaches us what home could possibly begin to mean. It is all important that we are passionate about ""place,"" or else we seek some disembodied spirit world that only the Gnostics could love."

Johnston was replaced by Gen. John Bell Hood who launched poorly coordinated and futile attacks on Sherman's forces, decimating his army and losing Atlanta in the process.

"The title of the new season of BIGGEST LOSER is NO EXCUSES ... What a great title !!! We can find an excuse for anything we want, but the TRUTH IS that God knows all of them and is just not buying them - He did after all send his son to the cross for us ... He knows us more intimately and deeply than anyone ... Our fears and reservations just spill out to him ... WE CAN HIDE NOTHING ...."

"'Cloaked' is unlike 'Beastly' in that it does not incorporate only one fairy tale into the plot. While I had heard of the story of The Frog Prince, there were six other stories weaved together which I was unfamiliar with. The way in which all these classic tales came together to make a new one was interesting, compelling and most of all, fun."

"Nottingham plays up its connection to Robin Hood, although he really only came here in raids – surely they should make more of their infamous Sheriff. Maybe a Sheriff Trail rather than a Robin Hood Trail (which doesn’t really relate to any of the buildings it is traced around)."

"Instead of taking Mikayla to meet Santa for the first time, I take Jonathan alone. And as he climbs up on Santa's lap, I get a tear in my eye thinking of what should have been. I cannot help myself. I try to do all of the things that everyone expects me to do, but I just cannot seem to do them with a true joy in my heart. It's not that I don't desire for my feelings to be different, I want to enjoy all of the usually wonderful things about this season, but I am just having a difficult time figuring out how to do that most days."

"The year 2012 is a milestone for me. It marks 40 years since my first job in the field of developmental disabilities – 35 of those have been with the same organization. It’s hard to imagine a more vibrant piece of this field’s history than the one since 1972. The I/DD field of the 1970s (probably inspired by the civil rights era of the 1960s) saw an explosion of activity; the birth of countless community options, the expansion of education and research, the emergence of whole new professions and specialties. And, there was money. In 1971, federal dollars flowed in the form of funding for ICF-DDs and the eventual waiver programs that followed."
"I love that he did this song! I love that he openly pens his love for black girls and I love that it’s causing controversy because it’s bringing awareness and opening dialogue about interracial relationships between white men and black women and the desireability of black women. But the one thing I love more than the controversy and the attention is that other white male celebs are jumping on his twitter and voicing their love for black girls too. By them doing that, it sends the message that there is nothing wrong with voicing it publically! Say it LOUD. I LOVE BLACK GIRLS and I’M PROUD!!!!!!"

"The new pantry configuration is a combination of solid shelves on one wall and ventilated shelves on the other (all the way up to the ceiling!)

"On Wednesday, I wrote about my belief that Christians need to rediscover that profound fast which Lent was once known for. In the same post, I also briefly mentioned the old tradition - but one that was new to me - of eating pretzels during the Lenten season. It seems that these savoury snacks were especially invented for the purpose of fasting during Lent - as a replacement for luxury foods."
This is the place I called ‘home’ for many months.
"The dong on Wednesday was little changed at 20,630 per dollar as of 2 p.m. local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The VN Index on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange tumbled 4 percent today and is down about 20 percent in 2011, the biggest fall in Asia."
"The problem with this opening scene is that it makes the Doctor’s army seem a bit weak by comparison. I’d have loved to see the Doctor have to compromise his own beliefs and convince the Cybermen to fight for him against the clerics instead of the Doctor going around and grabbing a bunch of people we haven’t ever seen before. There’s a Silurian female living in 19th century London and a Sontaran male forced to serve as a nurse and it really does come off as, “Hey, we’ve got a Silurian and Sontaran costume ready to be used!” instead of needing these people specifically. Captain Avery the Pirate from CURSE OF THE BLACK SPOT and “Danny Boy” from VICTORY OF THE DALEKS show up for a brief scene, but I would rather have seen these characters and Canton Edward Delaware III get the parts the Silurian, Sontaran, and fat, blue guy get here."

"I didn’t know what to say. I took the books. Inside the bag was Emma. He had also included Fitzgerald, Wilde, Salinger, Dostoyevsky, Dickens, Gogol, Brontes, Verne, and Bradbury. My mom laughed at the load I’d been given because up to that point, reading was not my thing. I could comprehend (I have always blown away proctors when taking comprehension tests) what I was reading, could read quickly, but found no enjoyment in it. As a teacher, I think she secretly hoped that Mr. Cartegena’s plan would work. It definitely changed my life."

I absolutely loved having our three children home - I lived for summer vacation even more than they did. But alas, they are all grown up now and so the end of school no longer holds the same appeal it once did for me. So I guess I will say the warmer temperatures and the opportunity to open windows and bring the outside in."

"Unfortunately Marko has decided to stop using the potty. I don't think it's just because of the new baby, because he was fine the first week. But with no one available to keep track of when he might need to go, physically lead him over to the potty, and sit down and read to him until he goes ... he's just not into it. If I just call from the couch ""please sit on the potty!"" it does not work at all. And he just doesn't seem to know when to go on his own. After the time when he peed on a stack of library books, and the time when he begged to be on my lap and peed on that, and the time when he sat in the baby's carseat and peed in that, I finally decided I was done with this, for now. I don't mind cleaning puddles off the floor -- it's a heck of a lot easier than changing a diaper -- but they don't always end up on the floor, but the couch, the clean laundry, his toys .... you can imagine, I'm sure. So I put him back in diapers."

"It took all I had to not turn around and to refrain from breaking into a run. It seemed imperative to be confident, to not show fear, to NOT turn around, though I was tensed for the smallest of noises which might indicate that they had even merely turned around to watch me go, their prey; I consciously identified as “the prey” during this ordeal. I heard the single crackle of a twig but I did not turn around, instead I laughed into the phone at some pretended bon mot. The tension was achingly palpable and I feared that to run would blow my confidence act and trigger a chase, if they sensed fear they’d know I was meeting no one on the trail, my charade would collapse, so I continued the “call” all the way to the parking lot and then, suddenly, I was running to the car, shoving Jamoka in the back seat, and hitting the button that locks all the doors."

"We opt for a high-end electric toothbrush that we received for a wedding present ten-plus years ago, but use manual toothbrushes for trips and camping. Environmental Toothbrushes is a company out of Australia (another awesome eco-place to be) that has put together compostable toothbrushes! The handles are made from one of my favorite renewable materials – bamboo and the bristles are a polymer that’s resistant to bacterial growth. The brushes come in medium and soft for adults and a child’s size, too. Beckett gets a kick out of having a “wooden” toothbrush."

"There are three things in this life that I truly love – eating, drinking, and my cat. Two of these I get to incorporate into my college life. The latter, a long distance relationship that leaves us both with strained hearts, I am sure. I indulge in breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, and dessert nightly. Dessert, according to Merriam-Webster, is a sweet course or dish usually served at the end of a meal. Thus, my vodka-sprite, my vodka-cranberry, my beer, and my occasional chocolate bar. I sometimes break the rules and spoil my appetite, consuming dessert before dinner. But I was taught growing up this is wrong, ill-mannered. So I do my best to hold off until the latter is taken care of. Always surrounded by what I love, I am a rather happy, rather successful student."

"If black is in fact the absence of colour or light, then silence is the black of the auditory realm. Quiet you can hear, but this was the complete and utter absence of anything – and I can’t stress that enough. Very occasionally you could head a distant moo of cattle or squark of a pheasant, but that only heightens the lack of sound the rest of the time. Nothing happening, the world just Is. It lifts everything from your shoulders, the world is put on pause… it’s wonderful."

"this is to confirm that the rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated, I've just been so busy with real life and my blog pays the price. am writing this in a rare spare moment before I rush to meet with my mom in south ken (planning on checking out the hummingbird bakery, about time!)."
"Not much else to tell you really as, apart from doing educational things with the children and shuffling around the caravan wheezing and taking up space, there isn't much left to write about! Oh, the house-spider season has started officially. I was sitting on my bed this morning when a large one came legging it over the top of my bolster cushion and across the duvet! I am A LOT better about large spiders than I used to be though and I'm not sure if this is because of the therapist I went to see in 2004 after nearly killing myself on the stairs after finding a spider under a cuddly toy, or because of my children, who are pretty relaxed around spiders. When the children were little, I used to deliberately go on ""spider-finding-missions"" where I would find a garden spider and show it to the baby/toddler and point out all the pretty stripes and colours and give it a cute little voice! Likewise, I used to try to hide my terror when finding a large spider in the house as I really didn't want to pass this phobia onto the next generation. Anyway, it worked and now I have children who can safely catch the big spiders and take them outside for me and watching the children being relaxed is slowly making me feel happier. All the same, I'll be glad when the spiders settle down into their Winter homes and stop dashing across the floors and surprising me in the shower!! Eeek!!"

"There are times in our lives when the storm moves through quickly, other times when it seems to settle around us and rain for months. Sometimes, we continue moving ahead, slowing a bit perhaps, but still focused forward. There are other times when we need to wait upon the Lord, praying that he will give us greater vision and wait for him to clear the way. It is seldom in life that we gain greater advantage by pushing blindly ahead, not compelled by faith and wisdom, but driven by the stubbornness of our own determination."

"First consider expenditure growth. People, 1985 - 2009 is 25 years. 48% growth over 25 years is, at a first approximation, something like a 2% annual growth rate. That just doesn't seem so bad a rate of spending increase. It's clearly below the rate of growth of real GDP. Is that really the same as the health care case?"
"Going from relaxed to natural hair can be an exciting, liberating experience, and there are two basic ways to get there. The fastest, no nonsense way to go natural is by simply cutting off all the relaxed hair in one fell swoop, or big chopping. But big chopping can require a strength that not everyone is equipped with at the outset of a hair care journey. For some, deliberate transitioning (complete with mini chops) is a necessary part of the “back to natural” process. And, if we really look at it, everyone who makes the journey must transition. Whether you big chop on day one of your thought, or a year after the initial thought, transitioning always starts with the mind well before any actionable steps are taken. In some circles, however, transitioning— especially long term transitioning, is seen as a sign of weakness. I argue, quite the contrary!"

The pearl trim and the brads on the sign are the only elements that weren't part of the wonderful kit this month. It's so much fun choosing what to use for a card from all the fabulous things that are included in each kit. If you haven't figured it out by now, I am LOVING these kits!! Give them a try, because I know you will, too!!"

"Both of these sides of the coin – the ineffectiveness of our ‘correctional institutions’ and corruption in the juridical process combine to ensure there are more victims. Not just from people who offend a second time, but also people who cannot, or do not dare to seek help before they commit a crime. How can you ask for help when the system will simply mark you as dangerous and then systematically take your life apart?"
"Mum is back in hospital after falling, her carer found her yesterday morning, she must have fallen before going to bed and had been on the floor all night. Apparently she managed to say she wanted the paramedics and to go to the “nice” hospital! I met her at A&E and they ran lots of tests. Last night we saw the doctor who went through everything. She is quite poorly, with lots of different things wrong which is worrying but she is in the right place and they really do seem to want to get to the bottom of it all."
"I wanted to continue with all that softness, so I chose to use flannel for the back. The top of my quilt was a little too small for a twin size, so I took a large flannel sheet and cut it down. I used the part I cut down for a border on the top. And the rest of the flannel sheet for the back."
"Magdi Cristiano Allam gave this opinion. Instead of proclaiming Christ to the Muslims, Europe responds to the phenomenon of Islam which takes religion seriously, with a ""reinforced religious relativism"" says Allam.

"One of the fun aspects of the course has been shooting weekly assignments. Every week the instructor would give assignments and each of the students were left to their own devices to fulfill the requirements. First assignment, we shot flowers. The flower assignment was easy enough. How could it be difficult, shoot some flowers and share them with the class. Next up, portraits. Again, cake assignment. Snap some pictures of people’s faces. Boom, boom, boom. Done. After finishing up the first few weeks of the course I felt pretty confident in my abilities as an amateur photog. Give me a concept to shoot and I am creative enough to come up with something that will both fulfill the assignment and give it a certain flair to make it my own."

"Your loved ones, your society, your religion, your constitution, your organisation, and your community - everyone wants to play the role of a painter in your life. There is no point in placing your life in someone else`s hands and then cribbing, crying and sobbing that you are not happy with your life. An obedient painting should gleefully accept what it has become, for it had chosen obedient surrender to its painter. Else, snatch the brush. They had their life and if they have missed the chance to paint their life it is their missed opportunity. The canvass of your life cannot be used for their experimentation. You may not have the genius of a Leonardo da Vinci, but it`s okay. Make the strokes you can; scribble; at least what comes out will be your making. Then, your life becomes your responsibility.

"6: Having failed with the ring-sling I decided to try the other option; the soft-structured carrier. Again, I researched all the different brands (and there are loads!), eventually settling on an Action Baby Carrier. I still own this sling, and I’d recommend it. It’s very comfortable for a front-carry, and quick and easy to get on. It has a sleep-hood that can be lifted if your baby falls to sleep to support their head. It’s just a really comfortable, everyday carrier."
"Bottom-line: 2012 outlook for global brands remains steady in China. On the retail side, insiders see a continued steady growth around 20% for the mid-to-upper level and luxury segments. The implication here is for local brands to continue to underperform for the balance of the year. In the end, 5% overall growth is still in the picture. Good year for Japanese in China, not bad for US, Korean and EUR brands."

"This is a black book I have. I started to write down dates that I had disturbing dreams – trust me, there are plenty. Eventually I began writing small snyopsis of the dream. I was trying to find some pattern. No pattern evolved over the five years that I religiously kept this list going. I did find though was pretty disturbing – things I was dreaming of were happening. So guess what I did? I listed this, every time something happened that made me think of a dream Id had I would note in the dream book in another colour under the dream. I wrote the date and what had happened. I think I began to scare myself so I stopped writing the dreams down."

"Saturday was tropical in weather and the girls and I started out in the sun by 11 or so. I ran in to get ice with Mist and encountered a grouchy store lady!! I will refrain myself from that story ;-) The day was incredibly heavenly! I could have stayed on that remote beach forever. After reading a few Voice of Victory articles to the girls, we had a delicious lunch of sauteed chicken and veggie tortillas. There we were all laid out in bikinis with the men off fishing and kids playing in the water. Matthew came back just as a helicopter flew over us. Then it flew over us again. Then it flew over AGAIN. We all started wondering what was up. Then it CIRCLED us!! ""What do they want to look at us for?"" Catman demanded to know. ""They weren't looking at us, Buddy"" Matthew told him."" ""Why would they want to look at girls in bikinis?"" he asked skeptically. We all laughed....... Guess nothing is all that secluded ;-) We girls swam out to the edge of the bay several times and hit the cold and waves of the great lake beyond. It was like time stopped and we were caught in a supernatural plain of some kind of heavenly sphere. The warm winds, the sand and shore, the cold waters and the waves, the mammoth mountains and the great boulders reminded us that we were but tiny creations living in this Eden that God Himself created for his children to enjoy...... That evening a great storm came up from out of no place and all us women and kids huddled in our trailer telling silly stories as the rain and hails passed us by. In an hour or two it was calm again and the men emerged soaked and fishless for the most part."

"I learned about healthy anger that alerts me to the presence of a problem that I need to deal with. Now, it also took practice to know where, when and how to express it. Sometimes, outside the hospital and the Anger Management room, I’d get angry and express it inappropriately. Caused some embarrassment for my family a few times, which I regretted. Eventually I learned to get it right, at least most of the time. The old adage, “Practice makes perfect,” is not really true, as my daughter’s orchestra conductor taught her. Instead, “Practice makes permanent, and perfect practice makes perfect.” So when I’d get angry, I’d slow down before just acting on it. I’d think about where, when and how to best deal with it. I’ve gotten better with it over time. Occasionally I still express anger inappropriately, which means I’ve gotten really good at saying I’m sorry and asking for forgiveness."

"Pete used the James reading to speak of how the Church has so frequently been hypocritical in the way it treats the rich in preference over the poor, he reminded us that we all have our blind spots and justify our failure to love our neighbour as Christ commanded us, with all kinds of very reasonable reasons which, if we thought about it for a moment, betray the Crucified Christ and all his teachings. I was taken particularly by a poem Pete read by Studdert-Kennedy (see below) and it was the image of Christ crouching against a wall in the pouring rain that inspired the picture."

The film was a major critical and commercial success, and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards. Additionally, the film gathered critical acclaim at several international film festivals, in addition to winning many Indian awards, including the National Film Awards. Khan himself won his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. After four-years of break from acting, Khan made his comeback with Ketan Mehta’s The Rising in 2005, and later won a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance for his role in Rang De Basanti (2006). Later on he worked with Yash Raj film “Fannah” in which he played a negative role with Kajol as his love interest. In 2007, he made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par, for which he received a Filmfare Best Director Award. In 2008 Khan appeared in the movie Ghajini. The film was a major commercial success and became the highest grosser of the year while this year he will be seen again in Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots with Kareena Kapoor."

"The parallel between today’s debate over homosexuality and earlier debates in which the Church was eventually forced to acknowledge they had erred is striking. We’ve already witnessed a global shift in this debate in that those few passages often quoted to claim the moral abhorrence of same sex relationships are now being reinterpreted by steadily growing numbers of evangelicals, Bible scholars and others, just as texts have been reinterpreted in the case of slavery, the ordination of women and a host of other issues. For those under the age of 35, same sex marriage is not even an issue."

"Investment in foreign land by large companies, or land-grabs as they have become known, have drastically increased in popularity since the beginning of the millennium. The majority of these investments have taken place in Sub-Saharan Africa where vast amounts of land, up to 90 percent in fact, is owned by the state rather than the individuals that live, work and die on it. This makes it easy for governments to sell this land to foreign companies looking to start up business, most of which is agricultural, in the area."

"There are only about fifty Honus Wagner's cards but most of them are in poor condition. Wagner did not want his image on a tobacco card and was therefore removed from the set which already make his card harder to obtain. The book is about the one known as The Card.

You can refinish classic antiques and paintings get retouched but baseball cards must not be altered. There are card doctors who remove stains, smooth out wrinkles, build up soft corners, change memorabilia patches, and laser rough edges. The book explores the serious doubts about the authenticity of The Card and its current condition."

Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit.

However, I must also admit that this was an incredibly frustrating book, and if I must compare to his other books, this is probably my second least favorite of anything of his I’ve read.

"Cleveland fans are in a difficult spot, especially for fans who have followed the team throughout the 1980s. Naturally, any fan of the Browns has no problem rooting for any team that plays the hated Steelers, but it may feel a little strange rooting for the team that sent Cleveland to some of its most devastating losses in the 1980s behind QB John Elway. For many, that might not be a problem, and Cleveland’s sports bars are likely to be crowded by fans watching and hoping for a miracle from the Tebow-led Broncos."
"He points out that the message is that people are sinful, they must repent and believe on Christ, and that it will be costly to follow him. While sharing the good news, we must communicate the urgency of their need for Jesus, as well as explaining that all of the sacrifice involved in being a disciple of Christ will be worthwhile. We must base our appeals on scripture, and ultimately leave the results up to God as our efforts are bathed in prayer (126-130)."

"If many of Arizona’s defenders and critics hold one belief in common, it’s that the new “show me your papers” law is sui generis: it’s seen as one angry border state’s response to its outsized share of America’s illegal immigration crisis. But to label this development “Arizona’s folly” trivializes its import and reach. The more you examine the law’s provisions and proponents, the more you realize that it’s the latest and (so far) most vicious battle in a far broader movement that is not just about illegal immigrants — and that is steadily increasing its annexation of one of America’s two major political parties.The rest is as argument-free and as invective-filled as the beginning. Opinionators like Rich don't bother to offer reasons, they simply denounce, the ""point-and-sputter"" method of debate. Which I'm sure goes down well with the average Times reader."

Of course I knew that there were cities in Texas, and skyscrapers, freeways and shopping malls, but I'm a child of the fifties, and was brought up on Dick West and the Lone Ranger. So of course I looked for signs of cowboys. They were easy enough to find. And along with the whites, in cowboy hats or not, there were of course Blacks, Hispanics, Chinese, the whole rainbow of peoples that makes a place vibrant."

"Chapter 6 of Shawn Ritenour’s Foundations of Economics examines what happens when the supply or demand of a good or service in the marketplace changes. Ritenour makes the point that confusion sometimes results from a change in market prices. When the price of, say, coffee rises, this is not necessarily indicative of a rise in demand. Demand may be exactly the same as before, but a reduction of supply may have led to the price increase. The reverse is also true; a price may change even though supply is constant if demand changes."

"Conservatives also love to remind us of the intense scientific debate surrounding these issues, especially global warming. However, regarding global warming, an accurate depiction of the debate would look something like 97 scientists debating 3 scientists (who are often funded by industries who rely on practices detrimental to the environment). Most of the debate involves the quantity of change expected and whether or not man can reverse this trend. Despite which side is more right, almost all research indicates that mankind must pursue a starkly different approach to how we relate with the environment."

I explained to her I was upset that I was not able to solve this on my own, that as a professional and as a mom I felt like a failure. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever heard as a mom. She said even if I was the best race car driver in the world and I had the best car ever built I could not win the race if a tree fell across the track. Someone would have to remove the barrier so my car and I could continue on our journey. It was not my fault that nursing was not going well.

"Such a development would be troubling in any country, but that is particularly true for Mauritania, which suffers from serious deficits in governance and an easy availability of arms. The insecurity is even more pronounced in the north of the country given its proximity to the Western Sahara, a conflict-ridden territory. Cross­border traffic of illicit products with the Western Sahara has been a booming industry, with the Polisario Front, which is fighting for the Western Sahara’s independence from Morocco, dominating the supply side of arms to Mauritania. A 2008 report by the Mauritanian Department of National Security estimates that the number of uncontrolled weapons in Mauritania stands at 70,000. This “has led to a wave of criminality due to the fact that it is easier and easier to procure arms of different types and calibres, including weapons of war,” according to a study by the Small Arms Survey."

"I know I only have myself and 6,000 glasses of Pinot Grigio to blame, but man do I ever feel like Hell. Ugh. I seem to recall hitting on a gay man for a while. And I have two mystery injuries on my knees, which means I fell down at some point during the evening. Classy! And I vaguely remember grabbing the mike of one of the cheesy Sweeny Sisters-esque wedding singers and belting out the Jane Wiedlin part in the bridge of ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" and later, posing for compromising digital photos at the Bar at the Four Seasons. My significant cleavage and pointy tongue will be coming to a website near you soon, I'm sure."
c. The third hole was placed near the bottom of the drum approximately an inch and a half from the bottom. This would be for an additional spigot so that emptying the drum could be done and so that a hose could be attached for larger watering jobs. (I plan on putting a quick connect on this bottom spigot on each of my barrels so that I can quickly connect my hose to each of them.)

"We decided to start getting back as the sun was starting to set, but first we had to deal with a huge people-jam. Whilst we were amongst it all, we thought we would never get out. I was very convinced it was a dead-end as there could be no other reason for all these people also struggling to move in the opposite direction to us. 15 minutes of my life wasted later and we were out. I felt successful. On the way back to the bikes I saw a scout stall selling t-shirts which I regret not buying. They said “I crown(in picture form) NL”. I don’t have a t-shirt to signify my stay in the Netherlands and this one seemed very nice in comparison to the ones we would see the next day in Amsterdam. I also want this one in town that says “I rain cloud (in picture form) NL”. However they only stock this in XL and man size. The burden of being a women."
"There's something so enticing, about Low Country style houses. They have that relaxed mix of country, coastal and West Indies that just works together perfectly. I can imagine sitting on the porch and feeling the breeze come off of the ocean or marshland.. I love the use of shutters and carriage house style lighting. A red brick pathway in a herringbone pattern, flanked by lush greenery and palms in this photo above looks so inviting..."

"We decided to take a drive to the North Shore side of San Angelo State Park. We had received a cell phone call as we were heading for the South Shore. It was Kim, one of the hosts at the north portion of the park. She said that I might want to come over there and photograph a Yellow-headed Blackbird that was chasing around the prairie dog town. Well, it was ten minutes away, and by the time we got there the blackbird was nowhere to be seen."

"Two and a half years ago I went on and on about this layering idea. I still think the first layer isn't something we want to skimp on. For the look we want, it's still really important. The part that hasn't really worked out so much, though, is the plan to complete the first layer everywhere before moving on to the second and third. Shoot - we're three years into this as of this weekend and I haven't posted a single thing about the second layer."
"You’ll cheer with delight as we pour 2 tons of snakes from the observatory into the arena where your child will be waiting as snakes rain from the sky.

"We are chosen, royal, holy, and adopted! We have got to embrace that identity and start acting like it. Many Christians walk around like Eeyore when they should be bouncing off the walls like Tigger. Where’s the joy, adopted one? Where’s the security, you who are chosen? God has called us out of darkness and into His glorious light, yet we continue to run for the shadows. We forget who we are and let the lie define us. We get caught in the trap of who we used to be and it keeps us from living for Him."

"The only thing I hate more than the sudden stoppers are the walking readers. Sometimes it’s not just books. I’ve seen people with huge open newspapers. Scream at them to “Look Out!” If this doesn’t get them looking up from their book or whatever, then trip them with a casual foot sweep. They won’t know what hit them. In fact, throw in walking Gameboyers with this group too. Hell, let’s add the walking Texters as well."

"I love you more each time I talk to you. You totally rock, and i am so glad that i can count you as a friend now, and some one I can talk to as a person and as a woman. I know I wasn't an easy kid to raise (though compared to that brother of mine, I was a fair walk in the park, wasn't I?) and I sometimes wish I could go back and just kick my own ass for some of the stuff I did and said when I was younger. But I guess that's part of getting older, isn't it, wising up and realizing what an ABSOLUTE BONEHEAD you've been all your life. I am still a bonehead, but at least now I recognize it, and I just want to say thanks for dealing with me all these years. By rights, and you would have been forgiven, I am sure, you should have put me in the burlap sack and tossed my annoying ass in the pond, there to sink or swim, but you didn't and for that I say thank you."

"This dessert is a total breeze to make, however very impressive and satisfying. I think the warming spice blend successfully compliments the sweet, peachy goodness without being overwhelming. The blueberries, although optional, add amusing punctuation marks throughout the dish, and when crushed release an exquisite swirl of magenta juice. The coconut ice cream is an absolute must, especially if it’s new to you. It’s totally vegan, free of crazy additives, unpronounceable ingredients, and tastes incredible. My favorite brand is Coconut Bliss. Alternatively, you could use canned coconut milk, but keep it in the fridge before serving to ensure it’s cold – the temperature contrast is key."
