I was not wonderful, it reminds me of that quote, from WWII era forget it but goes on to say something like, “It was not that I was a hero, it was everyone around me was acting so badly” when someone won a humanitarian award.\n",

Being friends with anyone wasn’t an option. It became a well-know fact that he couldn’t get along with others, especially in confined places. Whenever he was in the general population, he pursued fights on a daily basis. Arguments were his passion and ”asshole” soon became his middle name. Not even the meanest of the mean would mess with Herbert. The years put a definition of anger in the creases of his drawn face. The look of a psychopath was naturally etched into his smile. Inmates made it a point to stay away from Herbert whenever he wasn’t being kept in solitude. However, when he was alone, away from all other prisoners, Herbert was the perfect inmate.

Like if you break a ceramic plate into a million little pieces and you glue every single one back together, no one would want to hang that plate on the wall. But did you know that when you put a piece of ceramic stone in the kiln, the heat automatically creates millions of litte cracks…that were meant to be there? So the stone ends up being cracked…but in a beautiful way. People end up paying thousands of dollars for what appears to be a cracked piece of stone. So maybe we’re just not broken, but just beautifully cracked. And that’s the way it was meant to be.”    1\n",
