"Sugar’s sweet, so is she,"
"So because the Asian community was so by need tight-knit, the next thing you know I have Asian kids following me around, you know doing more shit for me than the boys that wanted inside of me. Especially the two in particular. They thought I was “so wonderful” which sickened me even further. I was not wonderful, it reminds me of that quote, from WWII era forget it but goes on to say something like, “It was not that I was a hero, it was everyone around me was acting so badly” when someone won a humanitarian award."
Nicholas’ brain runs on and is excellent at processing data and concrete facts. He works best with things he can quantify. He runs into an almost insurmountable challenge in trying to rationalize the existence of his exceptional infant daughter and what she represents. He isn’t without a sense of humor and is very loving but he is forced to radically confront his limitations.

"His own family had to witness exclusion and had to be apprehensive to be pusuited. So his grandfather decided to escape from germany in 1934, heading to Britain. This must never happen again, Andy says, and he tells about his worries about right-wing partys in Europe, which seem to get more popular again."

"My sweet boy, who I dote on, is quite capable of doing this (resisting training) for months. He has in the past and patience and consistency are called for and will win the day in the end. He might decide to get with the program this week, or it might be months. Time will tell, but I think I know now that this is a likely response from him when training goes to a new level."
"And so on, and so on..."
"For some reason I didn’t initially investigate any further into her catalogue, but then one Friday at work I was talking to another friend who loved Ann Peebles. The next day, on my way into town to the shops, I decided I simply had to buy a Peebles record. My first stop was Reckless in Berwick St, which still had a basement where a box of soul singles sat on the counter. Having inherited not only my dad’s hoarding tendencies, but his acute sense of relative value, I’ve never bought many 7″s (or “45s” as we must trendily refer to them now) and 9/10 times I deliberately avoid looking beyond the LP and 12″ sections in any shop. I was on a mission this time though and miraculously, as I began to flick, there it was, second record in the box, as if I’d just willed it there. I excitedly parted with my £3 and while I have no memory of what if anything else I bought that day, I remember it was definitely raining. Getting the record home, I had a bonus discovery with the equally brilliant b-side, part of whose intro is the backbone to a GZA track I was a bit obsessed with at the time (a huge proportion of early RZA production relies on the Hi back catalogue). In contrast to the a-side, the song is much more positive than its title indicates: she’s bidding goodbye to her troubles and sadness, or rather, as is more customary for Peebles, telling them to piss off."
"Forest City Ratner Companies and its Brooklyn Events Center subsidiary would have a tiny fraction of the jobs. Some 1000 part-timers would be hired by AEG, in charge of arena operations, and 900 hired by Levy Restaurants, in charge of food service."
"Then, the most exciting news of all, on August 19th our sweet baby Jane joined our family! She was born at 1:59 am after 7 hours of labor (which was so much better than Annabelle's 16 hours of labor) and was 7lb 6oz 20 in long. Jane looks a lot like Annabelle when she was a baby but they definitely have their own personalities. We are so happy this sweet baby girl could join our family and Annabelle loves her new little sister! Jane is such a little live wire. Right when Jane was born she could lift her head and was always moving. She isn't my cuddly baby like Annabelle was but still a sweet, happy little one. She moves so much she learned to roll over at 3 1/2 months! Now at 5 months she is army crawling everywhere!!! Crazy huh! She is just a little determined one and is probably going to walk soon I swear!!! Jane just had her 4 month Dr appointment and she weighed 12 lb 2 oz which makes her only in the 10th percentile . She is just a little one and it's probably because she moves all the time. Annabelle is such a good big sister and loves to make her laugh. If she is sad she gives her toys and tries everything to make her happy. But there are those moments when I hear Jane cry and I see Annabelle trying to ride on her back like she does with daddy, but I guess that is just what big sisters do. :) It gets kind of crazy being a mom of two now but I love it and it is always an adventure!"

"The firm of TrimTabs itself is taking a cautious stance and reducing its market exposure to zero from 50% exposure. TrimTabs’ reasoning is that the end of QE2 to spell the end of the ‘propping up of the market’. While certainly understandable, this is information that is all too well known and already priced into the market. They go on to write to their clients that the “S&P 500 is down 6.8% from its interim closing high on April 29, and we expect market action to get even uglier this summer.” Their terrible track record makes it tempting to fade them here."

"Wrists (bind): On a successful attack by a whipwhirl to bind an opponent’s wrist, there is a possibility the victim will “fumble” and drop anything it might be holding in its hands. The base chance of a fumble from a whipwhirl wrist attack is 100%, minus 5% per point of dexterity of the affected target (e.g., a character with a dexterity of 18 would have a 10% chance of fumbling on this type of attack.)"

"Here is a video where I talk about the tips and give you a tour of the system. I tried to write as clearly as I could in this post, but sometimes it’s better to just see it in action because it is tough to explain:"

"There are lots of guidelines - which lots of people treat as immutable laws - like 'show don't tell' and 'don't use 'was'' and so on. There are lots of distractions, like 'use 12 pt Times Roman' (I have never submitted a MS in 12pt Times Roman, and I have never had one rejected because it was in the wrong font). If I tell Adrian how I write, he might think that's my prescription for successful writing. It's not. It's possibly a very bad way to write - for other people. But it works for me. He will have his own way of writing that works for him. So much for the activity of writing - I'm not going to say 'you have to have a detailed plan' or 'never write a detailed plan'. But what I want to get Adrian to do, when I talk to him about his novel, is to understand what he is writing and how it works or could work. So I ask him questions like 'who is the narrator?' It is an omniscient narrator. 'Does this narrator have a character? Is he/she reliable? How do you switch between points of view? What are your main character's flaws? Which of his opinions do you share and which not? How does he change during the course of the book? Why?' And so on."

"I’m sure some of you have wondered how I got into western writing. I grew up watching Gunsmoke, Paladin, Bonanza, etc. My dad loved westerns. Top this with the fact I enjoy reading about history.

"Now any self respecting physicist, but more especially a graduate of Patrick Moore's 'Observer's Book of Astronomy', c.1969 (alpha-this, gamma-that is conspicuous in the winter sky, etc), should be able to read alphabetical greek... ""Argonautica... is that the Tim Severin expedition?"" - the one I'd read about in my father's Telegraph supplement? I'd just sailed back from Trebizond on the regular ferry after back-packing around Turkey. They'd just rowed a thousand miles in the opposite direction from Volos (Iolcos) to Georgia; their tremendous callouses bore witness to that fact, and to pretty useless winds. But they'd reached Jason's destination and found that people still ""pan for gold"" using sheep fleeces there, in the mountain streams."

"Grandma parked down the street from Bobby's house, and she and I crept noiselessly and hid in the bushes by his front walk. Then Grandma gave me a nudge. ""All right, Santa Claus,"" she whispered, ""get going."" I took a deep breath, dashed for his front door, threw the present down on his step, pounded his doorbell and flew back to the safety of the bushes and Grandma. Together we waited breathlessly in the darkness for the front door to open. Finally it did, and there stood Bobby."

"5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.

"It is ironically appropriate that the end of the bill’s main content is the definition of “self-protected entity”, a definition that when defined includes ANY entity other than an individual. It is important to encourage persons and citizens of democratic nations to read their laws and the legislation that affects them. Undoubtedly for some, this may be the first text of legislation they have ever read their entire lives, and it is important that they begin reading such texts. Do not let government spokesmen, or political and social commentators, though the screen or through text, tell you what is going to affect you, and how its going to affect you: You have a responsibility as a citizen to know what is going to affect you and your life, and of the lives that shall come after you. Internet Censorship."

I made an easel giftcard for a change. The card itself is made around a box of toffifee which cost me £1 from poundland. I removed the outer sleeve which leaves the chocolates still in their protective covering and used the sleeve as a template to make an outer wrapper for the box. I then made an easel card the same size as box which I attached to the box when it was decorated. It was quite easy to make and makes a nice (cheap) thank you gift! The papers and design are quite plain but I wanted the main focus to be on the image. If it wasn't a sample for TV and I was giving it away myself then I would probably make a matching box but I didn't bother.
"The second song litters the ear with a blistering insistent shower of metallic artillery of riffs, picking and spotting the senses like hailstones until a lull leads into a feisty and formidable display of towering riffs and sharp melodic manipulations.

"We grew up. We moved away. She's a social worker in Madison, now, and I'm an office manager and church organist in Milwaukee. We run into one another once in awhile at funerals. We both made it to adulthood, safe now from eagles, gypsies, and the threat of the Ickle Ockle bushes. I think of that on warm summer nights when the fireflies are out."
"Winter, the kind with snow, finally began here on Friday. It was short-lived though. I shoveled steps, decks, ramps, and pathways blanketed by six inches of heavy white stuff until my arm muscles turned wobbly. My mittens were stuck frozen to the shovel, and despite the frigid temps, my head under hat was laden with sweat. I felt like I had just finished an exhaustive hour-long gym workout. But like I said, the gorgeous winter snow was short-lived. Rain soon swept in and reduced the mass to about an inch or so of undulating ice. I have yet to try the car on the long downhill rink we call the driveway. A walk to the mailbox yesterday revealed coyote tracks, emerging from the woods into our drive and across the road. Bello, my feline walking companion, curiously sniffed the tracks, looking about with caution. I suspect that the coyote had walked as we did only a short time previous."

Written by Adam Gauntlett, whose previous contributions to titles published by Miskatonic River Press, Pagan Publishing, and Pelgrane Press, have all been well received, The Millionaire’s Special is a mini-adventure set on the RMS Titanic, in which several First Class passengers – or is that player characters – must face a threat already aboard the luxurious liner, whilst their players know that they will face certain death by adventure’s end."

No more putting off figuring out the rules for magic. The wizard has been backed into a corner and has to start explaining things to the trogg girl.

"Bad copy editing, on the other hand, introduces new errors while overlooking existing errors. Bad copy editing cites Wikipedia as a definitive source. Bad copy editing betrays cluelessness about the author's tone and style while revealing far too much about the copy editor's own limitations (and, perhaps, failed ambitions). Bad copy editing is painful. It takes time and is horribly enervating. Bad copy editing causes one to wear out pencils writing STET over and over. Stet is Latin for ""let it stand,"" which is to say, it is a veto of a correction. But if you have to write it too many times on a manuscript you begin to think it is actually the Latin for ""fuck off."""

"The much anticipated Sex and the City 2 movie has finally opened with lots of promotion and press as one might expect. I haven't seen it yet (have you?), but I've naturally been very interested in the look and feel of the movie. Based on the movie trailers and still photography that's floating around - we can definitely say that this movie is filled with color and texture. The TV series and first movie were more about the clothes, but this one seems much more about the (dare I say it?) surroundings. As Carrie says in the movie ""I've been cheating on fashion with furniture"". Music to our ears! Lots of other blogs and sites have been covering the interior design of this new movie, including lots of resources, so I'll post a link to those sites at the bottom. However, I thought it would be interesting to compare the evolution of the interior design from television series through the two movies. Since much of the creative team is the same, it makes for an interesting exercise, I think."

And ostensibly they abandon the sock and scramble after the treats and eventually they will abandon the sock on the command, no treats necessary."

And the past should stay the past, right, because people who tried to escape the labyrinth were seldom heard from again by those good and proper souls who kept their heads down and didn’t listen to the dreams that whispered to them in their waking hours. And you try not to think of all those wasted years in the darkness, because that only leads to Regret. And if Laziness is Fear’s bratty kid brother, then Regret is his sad-eyed spinster aunt."
"He likes to ""sweep"" with his little vacuum at any given time, but especially if he sees someone else using the real vacuum. Then he runs and gets his and follows them around. Cute. But this cute little habit has quickly become a weird obsession. He LOVES the real vacuum. If he sees it he goes crazy trying to pull the plug down and start pushing it. I have had to relocate it from its previous spot tucked between a shelf and a wall in the dining room to the mudroom. Oh and he loves brooms. The kid has a serious thing for brooms. He's constantly maneuvering himself around the gate to get into the mudroom to get one of the brooms and then he walks around sweeping. He does a pretty good job, to be honest! Or he tries to get the vacuum. It's a constant struggle with him. I'm pretty sure he wants to be a janitor when he grows up. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm just surprised that he's found his life's calling at 15 months old."
"Having qualified fifth, Alesi snatched third from his team-mate Gerhard Berger when the Williams of David Coulthard spun off on lap three. He eased past Damon Hill and on his 31st birthday, looked set for an excellent second place finish. For once, lady luck was shining on Alesi and dominant race leader, Michael Schumacher suffered a gear selection glitch that lost him a full minute. Driving the famous No.27 in Montreal, the number Canadian hero Gilles Villeneuve had in his Ferrari days, Alesi took the chequered flag at his 91st attempt. His Ferrari ran out of fuel on the slowing down lap to complete his lucky day. However after all the bad luck in his career, no-one could deny Jean his deserving moment on the top step of the podium."

"Kim Hyun-sung (Jang Hyun-sung), a hard-boiled fund manager, spends an evening of heavy drinking with his co-workers at a restaurant. A colleague shows up with some airsoft rifles, and soon all of them are pointing their weapons every which way and firing them in the busy restaurant. The server asks the guests to put the firearms away, and Hyun-sung ends up getting into a brawl with the waiter. The next day, following a probe into the company’s financial dealings and the suicide of one of his associates, Kim flees to the wooded retreat of one of his friends, hoping to recover his equilibrium. Instead, his buddy convinces him to take part in a war game with some friends. This vigorous if not wholly original exploration of the ruthlessness of business culture firmly embraces the dogme esthetic, the camera crew and boom mike being plainly visible in one restaurant scene.

I had one who spoke so softly I had to sit in front and still strain to hear. I had one who invited us all to his farm for the winter and summer solstice. He sat on his desk, swinging his feet, clad in dirty shit-stomping boots, smoking a pipe. I think he was high a lot. And I had one who scared the hell out of me. I don’t know why. But, he was a great English teacher and he loved poetry."

"Which leaves only it’s status as part one of an accidental trilogy (since Castrovalva wasn’t even remotely planned when this story and Logopolis wrapped). I suppose I’ve rather given the game away on that one by pointing out that it’s an accidental trilogy, but there it is - this is in no way intended to be the start of some high concept arc, and reading it through that lens is deeply misguided. Again, there’s some distant interesting aspect here - the way in which Bidmead and Nathan-Turner navigate the nearly impossible task of writing Tom Baker out of Doctor Who is an impressive piece of television show-running. They take the counter-intuitive but likely necessary approach of declining to make Baker’s departure the climactic event or allowing him to be the star of it, instead opting to build the Davison era’s trappings up around Baker and then finally delete him from a show that’s no longer his own. Certainly several major steps in that direction happen here."

"The massive, well-organized deployment of enormous sums of money by the business and (especially) the financial elites have in large measure made American politicians, regardless of party, into the tools of the wealthy elites: Bush cut taxes on the very rich to near-historic lows, and the right-wing Roberts court more or less legalized political bribery in the Citizens United decision, but it was Bill Clinton who began the deregulation of Wall Street that led first to massive profits for the few, then to an terrible crisis for the many, and it was Democrat Chuck Schumer who kept capital gains taxes so low that most hedge fund managers pay taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries. The Koch brothers and those of their ilk don't consider themselves stewards of national well-being, not really: they consider themselves people who have a right to buy the means to rig the system ever-further in their favor. For them, this is simply their prerogative. Acting on this presumed prerogative has made them very wealthy, but it has also made their whole class less and less legitimate in the eyes of the public, despite the constant drumbeat of political advertisements and the far-from-disinterested vision of events presented on Fox News and other corporate media platforms."
"My review of the first reading of Still Life can be found here (Feb 2009). I remember liking the book and being impressed with Penny's style of writing and I enjoyed the characters, hoping we would meet them again in future books. And we did get to chum with them in the sequels. Penny unwraps parts of each character and lets us slowly get acquainted with them as we might a new friend. In this reread I was reminded of earlier descriptions of the characters and to see them in light of what I knew about them from later writings. My word, they are such multi-faceted, complex, flawed, and yet lovable people. The following quote illustrates how well Penny brings her characters to life, as well as her understanding of human nature and her gift for expressing it in writing."

Also, no less important we want to give their parents a rest, some quiet and a little bit less to worry about.

Even at the age of 50, she’s far too tough on herself. V.I. does some considerable soul searching while assuming the persona of a champion whose mission it is to right injustice."

They are told that their donations are vital to “defend” or “protect” the Church, that they are key to “expanding” the Church (buying more real estate). So they give more and more money."
"The Theme is Spring cards and Violets always remind me of spring. Since I'm an amateur photographer, I also took a bunch of pictures of my spring violets, so I decided to use them as the focus in my card. I have a small collection of copic markers and have been practicing blending colors, so I though I'd try using my pictures I took."

Conducted with independent assurance from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the model measures the number of people globally who, on an average day, read FT journalism in print and online.

It lamely asserted that RAINBOW RESPOSABLE creates an incongruity because ""a reusable and disposable rainbow does not exist.""

"The rest of the night all I tried to do was think of other things to keep my mind off of what was going on. I said a prayer and actually felt pretty good after it was over and I took that as a good sign. Heavenly Father knows what is best for me. When I woke up all I wanted to do was get into the doctor and see my baby and to know what was going on. Lincoln came with me this time and we were both so nervous, I couldn't stop shacking. The Doctor walked into the room and said that he was thinking about me and worrying about the baby and said he was hoping that he was just over reacting yesterday. I started crying before the ultrasound even started. The moment she was on the screen you could see her little heart beating and right at that moment you could tell she was okay. Her heart was beating perfectly. She was up to 165 bpm again. Which is normal. I started crying such a wave a relief rushed all over me. I love listening to her heart it sounded so much better then yesterday. The doctor checked her again and again to make sure she looked great and she did. I am going back in 2 weeks to make sure she stays the same."

I may be a junkie for unliterary crack. I don't pretend to know what constitutes ""social substance"" or ""artistic importance"" in a short story--and I'm not sure that I'd want to read anything by a writer who was so self-important that they'd try to tell me something socially substantive or artistically important anyway!”"

"Posters and fences enclose the wasteland, although not much effort has been expended in keeping them up, revealing an absolutely huge, poisoned-looking grass expanse, broken up by two buildings and a public sculpture. The wager was that 'Boro might become a tourist destination, if Alsop and invited architects like FAT were to be given their head; the renders in front of the wastes show a Super Mario World which bitterly contrasts with what is in front of your nose. The public sector levelled the area for, so far, an optimistic temporary suite designed as an aptly upturned lime green box, and the new Middlesbrough College by Hickton Madely at Archial. This is a huge building, and aside from the Bridge it dominates Middlehaven, its curving mass covered in a silver and yellow cladding, with small windows punched into it at random. Round the back, it's a huge white shed, as if we wouldn't be looking. Far away is the other building – the Docks' Clock Tower, attributed to Philip Webb – tall, gaunt and profoundly haunting in this dreamlike, spacious and sinister context. Between the dereliction is red and black landscaping, carrying at least some of the renders' cartoonish promise, connecting the area to the football stadium, or to another publicly funded project – Anish Kapoor's Temenos."

"It is clear to me that in today’s context, the lever to move the world, or should I say equity markets, is free money. Sure, central banks don’t have a choice when the new orthodoxy is for governments to pursue austerity with great fury but it’s also expressly meant to lever the stock markets of the globe out of their doldrums."

"We are not even quite sure what the allure of Jack Falstaff is. We'll call it the 'James Ormsby Je ne sais quoi factor'. The attraction is certainly not the look of the space, hidden behind a sleek, industrial doorway. The interior is modern but ordinary, dressed in velvetines and sagemint greens that could have jumped straight from the pages of a West Elm catalogue. The ambience fares well from the low, highly-polished dark wooden ceiling that subdues the sound allowing a dinner conversation to flow with ease, thereby helping to keep the dining experience a relaxing affair."

Later, Absalom rebelled against his father… and he won the heart of many of the men of Israel as he formed a conspiracy to take the throne. A battle ensued… Absalom died, hung by his own hair."

My first mini album took me 9 months to complete... yes, I said MINI album... and I was so scared to tackle each page that I hesitated, scrapped, hesitated some more...

If you are new to scrapping or break out in hives when it comes to mini albums, here is one of my favorite design tips... Go simple and use ONE line of paper. Don't worry about matching this embellishment to this tag to that paper... choose a line of product that was designed together... it will all match beautifully and make your job MUCH easier!"

I realized that even if this was nothing, something, someday, something tragic and life changing is coming. Whether its to me or a loved one, its coming. And I need that reality to change my life.

"Stepping outside after dark was the biggest treat of all; a veritable cornucopia of astrological delight enveloped me and captured my immediate and unwavering attention. Had it not been for the incessant attack of viscous sandflies I could have stayed there all night, every night, gazing up in awestruck wonder. As it was, it became a nightly ritual, after putting the littlest hobo to bed we would head out into the inky darkness and stand in front of the house looking up for a few minutes, the void of silence echoing on the mountains that surrounded us.

"Well, this was one BIG issue with me since I couldn’t stand Baby #1 wrestling with the Lact-Aid. But this time around I learned a tip. Get one of those lactation bras where there is a triangle (my hubby calls them the butt-chaps bras because they look like those cowboy chaps with the whole for the bum). Stick the Lact-Aid in that space right at the middle and then run the tubing under the fabric that goes on top of your breast. This reduces the odds of it shifting around AND keeps you from having to use tape. Yes, the wrestling will still happen, but this helps."
"One may ask, How can something be inside and outside at the same time? Parīkṣit therefore names a prominent Vedic deity: Vāyu, god of the sky.

Similarly All-Attractive Hari is the soul within everyone and everything, yet is an individual person as well, greater than and distinct from everyone else."

"A president’s likeability is much overrated. Hoover may have been unliked, but the same can’t be said about incumbent losers Ford, Carter, and George H. Bush. Those presidents lost their re-elections because voters perceived them as unsuccessful in their jobs. Most voters would have gladly sat down over beers with any of those three men."
"Much more prominent in the novels than in the series. Novel Dark Passenger (DP) is portrayed as a separate, conscious entity that lives inside Dexter and drives much of Dexter’s Need to kill. It’s described as being able to enter a person who has experienced a severely traumatic event, especially as a young child. While some feel this “possession” element of the novels spoils the storyline, I think it adds an interesting supernatural element and allows for more storytelling freedom."
Days like yesterday make it all worth it.

"I am so grateful for the way that my faith shapes my life and my values and for the way that it strengthens me and leads me to good things. I am grateful that because of faith, I am able to be brave in the face of hard things, to feel joy in the midst of trials, and to have hope in the future. Could I be a mother without faith? Sure. But faith makes me a much better mother than I could ever be on my own."
"I notice no one's criticising Jennifer's extremely well muscled, well nourished looking male co-stars. It's fine for them to look as if they've been eating enough to keep alive. Apparently it's only female actors who have to bow to 'realism' to such an extent that they should look gaunt, bony and as if trying to draw a bow would snap them in half."
"Taylor took to the screen early in life, however, long before her shapely figure caught up with her beautiful face. I recall watching the National Velvet movies as a kid, but haven’t indulged in them lately. It is not often that child stars can actually last past their cute youth and make it in the grown up world of film. I almost separate Taylor into two actresses because the adorable, sweet roles of her childhood contrast so differently from the later work."
"A must-have book for all vampire fans, A Brief History of Vampires charts the phenomenal craze of ‘popular vampires’ such as Nosferatu and Count Dracula to screen vampires such as those played by Bela Lugosi and Robert Pattinson. With the current global vampire craze taking the book, film and TV charts by storms with the Twilight saga and True Blood, this book begs the question: why do we love to be frightened?"

"A bacteria to me looks like a blob that can move. That’s pretty cool when I think about it. A blob of mayonnaise can’t move (and I’m happy about that). But under the microscope, blobs move. Hopefully not the mayonnaise blob. But bacteria blobs move."
"“Well then,” I say cheerily, trying to lighten the mood. “Let’s go find some breakfast.” We split up and I pick some berries from the scraggly bushes growing in the rocks. Henry manages to find some mushrooms and two walnuts. Gypsy and Todd wait patiently while we dangle our feet over the edge and gobble down our meager breakfast. The fog is lifting and we can see for a few miles as the bottom of the ravine slowly climbs back up to meet the sky. My stomach still grumbles but I hand my walnut to Henry."

I have read blogs for years, I love reading blogs and have always wondered what I could have a blog about. Would anybody read it. What would I write about. Well there has been plenty for me to write about really but it's finding the time to sit down and actually write. So today, here I sit, looking at my very disorganised house, clutter everywhere and I have to do something about it! So I thought, I will blog about my disorganised life and hopefully it will become organised once again.
In a face-to-face interaction we can support our verbal message with our body language, for example, the former President Bill Clinton was known as a very capable public speaker. Much of what he said in his speeches was communicated with hand gestures. Gestures are a very powerful way to amplify one’s intentions in public speaking. They also serve as a channel to bring the audience into the speech (which Clinton excelled in). This is also one of the reasons why Clinton’s supporters or even non supporters believed what he said at the time. His gestures aided his overall credibility.
Ryan “So Hot the Water” Broyles tore his ACL in November 2011 the same way the compact receiver tore through BIG12 defenses, becoming the NCAA receptions leader with 349 catches. He will probably be selected in the 3rd round, although he could fall further. While his height is limited and his speed is unknown until he fully recovers, the kid a extremely talented and a solid route runner. He could end up being the steal of the the draft if he falls down further than the third round. If fully recovered, he should be able to contribute early. Just five months removed from his ACL surgery, Broyles recorded a 32.5-inch vertical jump and 4.57 time in the 40-yard dash at his Pro Day. There is no doubt that he should be faster by the start of the 2012 NFL season.

"Since watching a number of episodes of The Electric Company (yeah, Netflix!) she completely understands the concept of the silent E and while she doesn't know yet which words have a silent E and which don't, if she is struggling to say a word and I tell her ""silent E,"" she can immediately say it; she knows exactly what each vowel should sound like in that situation. I think it's really cool how easily she learned that and how well she knows the vowels' different sounds. The Electric company has also taught Sweet Pea how to read words with 's or 've or 'd, etc. at the end. She doesn't yet fully understand possessive uses of apostrophes, but she totally gets that ""doesn't"" is a contraction of the words ""does not."" It is incredible how easily she picks up some of this language stuff!"

"For there was something fundamentally very evil going on in that school, though my brothers and I were fortunately, miraculously untouched by it. During the years I was there, five of the ten teachers (three brothers and two laymen) were sexually abusing many of the boys entrusted to their care. One of them was the tall young brother teaching the class parallel to ours, a class in which I was often a guest on the (not infrequent) occasions when Mr. Mooney called in sick. His ready use of the cane ensured that he had no discipline problems. He also had the custom of having boys sit on his lap for long periods of time – fortunately, he had his particular pets and we guests were not selected for this “special” treatment."

We, the unseen masses of men, women, and children with broken pee machines, are usually crippled by a bladder flare."

"Oppression is what the non-dominant groups of a category experience, which is essentially not having the same treatment and access to resources/privileges as the dominant group. For example: Aboriginals receive a significant amount less from welfare than non-Aboriginals. Internalized oppression is when an oppressed person begins to believe the stereotypes and awful statements about their group; for example, a Black woman begins to believe that she is not as deserving of fair treatment as White people are, or a gay man believes he is a sinner and is flawed for ‘choosing’ to be gay. Lateral violence is when, as a result of this, an oppressed person retreats to his or her group, or perhaps lashes out at the dominant group or at the very least, refuses to interact beyond his own culture; we see this when people react poorly to interracial dating, for example."

"Knowing it is indefensible, the various self-investigatory reports will try to hang their underlings out to dry and tell us Mark Kennedy was a rogue officer straying off-mission. When all seven exposed officers behaved more or less identically, the police need to tell us how many it takes to prove that far from following orders, this was strategy. And more than that, who devised, approved and ordered this political policing?"

"The other day I was looking at the line up for The Great Escape and I couldn’t help but be amused and pleased by a lot of the band names. Forgive me for not being more ‘down with the music-o people’, but I hadn’t heard of a lot of them, so these band names were completely new to me. I wanted to share some of my favourites on Twitter, but the list was getting longer and longer, so I thought I’d bore anyone that’s going to accidentally stumble across my blog with it."

That’s because the difficulty level is dynamic, based on the players competing."

"Some accounts state that wedding rings did not become common until the 11th century. Others believe the ancient Romans were the first to offer wedding bands, but they were a symbol of ownership used to claim women. Historic accounts give a little more romance to the Romans. Roman betrothal rings were once made of iron and called ""Anulus Pronubus."" They symbolized strength and permanence. It is also thought that the Romans were the first to engrave their rings."

"Finally, there is a new butcher, imaginatively titled ""The Butcher Shop"". It's near Woolworths, in the square in the corner. From Woollies, go past the chemist and jeweler, and look to the right, across from the Shiny Things Shop. (Not its real name.) They're in the new tradition of butchers, with house-made sausages and ready made kebabs and marinated ready-to-go roasts. They stock King Island beef. I haven't checked all the details about what's local and what's free range yet, but I can say that the sausages, silverside and lamb chops that I've had so far have all been top quality."
"Well, after putting up with his insults (like ""nice bangs"" in reference to my current Yul Brynner 'do) I actually piledrive the kiddo a few times which doesn't do much for him, given his spine seemed to be made of a slinky.

The rapier-like witticisms kept on a'comin' (I remember him shouting ""Keep your cholesterol-laden hands off me!"" as I tried yet another debilitating wrestling move) though soon the social intercourse (no, not that!) was broken up by none other than mother, who chastized me for treating company in such a way even if that company was an annoying rock critic bigmouth who was more'n responsible for helping destroy the Generation of Bangs and Meltzer and turning it into one big Voice of Whoredom!"

Ingram ~ With You ~ Other End ~ 1984
"While he had a strong enough grip to get the job done in college, I’d like to see Andrew continue to improve his functional strength at the next level. He shows good hand placement with proper technique in his ability to fire his hands inside on the defender and uses his flexibility and wide frame to make it difficult for rushers to get around him on the edge. I’d like to see Datko get stronger in the lower half in order to improve as an anchor in pass protection, as he isn’t yet strong enough to take on and consistently neutralize some of the bigger, stronger ends he’ll face at the next level. He’s not a full-fledged drive blocker in the run game, and while he’s shown enough of an ability to execute down blocks in college, I’d like to see him continue to develop better lower body strength to improve here. In the run game, he uses his quick feet off the ball to his advantage with his ability to engage the defensive lineman off the ball before attempting to properly position the defender away from the hole to wall him off an open up a clear running lane. Having played in Florida State’s zone-blocking offense, he could be an intriguing fit for the Packers blocking scheme."

"Sometimes after a long day of wandering and singing and climbing trees and playing, we would lie down in a cool green thicket under a lacy curtain of wisteria, and Rabbit would fold his arms around me prayerfully. I would rest my head in his warm hair and he would say, “I love you too much to ever use you.” He was one of the dearest men I have ever known, and I regret losing track of him when he moved away to the west coast."
"Even though the Powhatans returned the prisoners and some of the equipment they had captured, the colonists were not satisfied and a year-long negotiation began. In that time Pocahontas remained captive in the town of Henricus where she fell under the influence of Reverend Alexander Whitaker, who persuaded her to embrace Christianity. While there she also succumbed to the romantic advances of John Rolfe, a pious tobacco planter who had recently lost his wife. After being baptised under the new name of Rebecca she married Rolfe on 5th April 1614. In January the following year, the couple had their only child, Thomas Rolfe. While the marriage did not secure the return of all the colonists' possessions, it did cement amicable relations between them and the Powhatans."
"Our attending this show was an idea that came about because we need to reach a new audience.

You know, I think (much like Oprah – another childless mommy advisor) that the hardest thing you can do is raise a kid. And even harder is raising a kid right and saving the world from the addition of one more a**hole. This is of such monumental importance in my opinion, that it does, indeed, take a village. So, I’m here to help. As I was working up some research this morning, I came across some parenting ideas / actions/ products that I feel could lead your child astray. I am here to try and stop you…or rather stop the ridiculous human being who would subject their child to any of the below."

"It was once that individuals that have been going offshore on cross country cruises selected boats that had been extremely heavily built and were generally not to fast, often unresponsive using conditions. Tactics on these boats were somewhat distinct from the engineered boats these days. These older era boats could well be forced to heave to or lay a hull in two extremes. The crew would close everything up and go below and wait out. Sometimes this was successful, sometimes it wasn’t."

"But as with any adaptive strategy, it eventually becomes maladaptive. If an organism cannot evolve to match changing conditions--in this case, rapid fossil fuel depletion, climate change, soil degradation and so on--then dieoff or extinction can follow. And, just because I and many others can articulate the problem, it does not at all imply that a meaningful and broad-based understanding can spread and that a response can be implemented in time to avert the worst. Every fiber of a human being instinctively rejects limits on energy gathering--unless those limits can be framed as a necessary sacrifice for the good of a group to which that human being feels a strong attachment."

In the midst of feeling excited that it’s nearly time for my favorite Farmer’s Market to open, and in the midst of being happy that the warmer weather will soon be moving into Rhode Island and making it easier and more pleasant to eat lighter, fresher foods, I was nervous about how to actually plan and execute almost a whole month’s worth of gluten and casein free fare for us.

"It was all set to the primal rhythm of a steady thumping backbeat complemented by a bass line hitting you everywhere. It caused dancing of the simplest pattern; hop hop, switch foot, hop hop, switch foot, hop hop; arms swinging back and forth in time to the movement of the always bouncing feet. The grass was bright and green and standing when the man next to me started dancing this basic jungle influenced sway. By mid concert he had danced the grass flat, by nights end, to mud."

"This book just didn't do it for me, I'm sad to say. I think it does a good job in dealing with issues and questions that come up in the family dynamic. I liked that the point of view switches between each of Leah's family members instead of focusing on just the parents' viewpoint or just Leah's viewpoint. It showed how lack of communication and even miscommunication can create problems for a family. However, I like my fiction to have a balance. This book is just one depressing situation after another. Right after things start to seem a little better, another horrible thing happens. I will venture to say that most of our lives are filled with quite a bit of happy moments among the sad, frustrating moments, and I would have liked to see more of that."

After locating the car and returning it to their home, Cindy Anthony searched it and found a purse with information on a friend of Casey’s. Cindy asked the friend to take her to Casey’s boyfriend’s house. She confronted her daughter and demanded to see Caylee. They drove around for a while, then Casey finally admitted that she didn’t know where her daughter was. Returning to the Anthony family home, Cindy finally called police. Casey spoke to the 9-1-1 operator as well, and calmly told them that her daughter had been missing for four weeks, but she was afraid that her abilities as a mother would be questioned by authorities, and that is why she did not report the disappearance."

Be witty and charming and keep offensive opinions to yourself…. if you would like to be invited back), help clear the table (scrape the plates, rinse and stack. That’s enough.

First time writer/director, Warwick Thornton follows the film's two protagonists, a pair of Aboriginal kids living in a run-down community in Central Australia.

In fact, it was government policy that ‘Mother Tongue Education’ was compulsory for ALL RACES during the early formative primary school years.

I had never blown the insides out of an egg before without using specialized tools, but after googling how to do it and reading the first tutorial I came up with, I found out that it was pretty easy.

The eggs didn’t break."
"From the reptile store we hopped on a bus down to Jackson Square to hit the Farmer's Market for some lunch.

I find it extremely sweet, although that's not necessarily a bad thing after a spicy samosa!"

My hair is poker straight, won’t hold a curl and often has a mind of its own. It also can’t decide on what color it wants to be. It was blonde when I was really, really small. Then it was a mousey brown in early elementary school. Mid-elementary through my late teens it looked like it was chocolate brown until you got me in the light or sun and then I had a really dark auburn color."

"Historically server power benchmarks were not available and thus the only way for initial data center power planning was to rely on power data provided by system vendors in the form of faceplate values. But the use of faceplate value is flawed at the first place as it indicates the maximum power requirements for each component irrespective of its configuration or utilization. But the power consumption of a system is linearly correlated with its utilization. Because of this, a huge gap exists between the data center’s anticipated power require­ment and the actual power required by its equipment. Another option which is used is fixed de-rating where an arbitrarily percentage or number is subtracted from the nameplate value considering that the system’s faceplate rating is higher than its actual use. For example a 1,000 watt rated server would be de-rated by a fixed 20 percent which means you are assuming that it would consume 800 watts. However this is not true as its power consumption would be dependent on the utilization and estimated value most often is grossly inflated. As you might think, finding the correct percentage by which de-rating should be done is nearly impossible without any measurement tool. Two servers of the same manufacturer and model can consume different powers because of the utilization."

"Beatrice Shilling OBE, PhD, MSc, CEng was a highly talented aeronautical engineer - and motorcycle racer, gaining a Gold Star at Brooklands for her 106mph lap. She became hugely famous when she found an elegantly simple cure for the engine cutting-out problems experienced by Spitfire and Hurricane pilots when making extreme turns. It was a simple fuel-restriction device, like a washer with a needle valve, that was fitted into the SU carburettor and solved (nearly) the problem until pressurised carburettors were fitted to the Merlin engine. The little device became known as ""Tilly's orifice"" - and many of our brave fighter pilots owed their life to it."

It's chock full of loads of North American hops and has a sweet kick to it and a strong, pungent aroma that reminds some of cat piss. Others, such as Brown, of ""damp dishcloths"". For some in the room, it was their first experience of such a big beer. It was interesting watching peoples reactions. Some were instantly taken by it. Others, slowly won over by it."

But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. James 1:4 (KJV) You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. Hebrews 10:36 (NLT) “I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don’t tolerate evil people.” Revelation 2:2 (NLT) “I know all the things you do.

"Most gluten free bread is sold frozen. At best is is dense, and tastes funny. After moving to Austin, I went to the Whole Foods downtown for some lunch and shopping. The Whole Foods in Austin is HUGE. It is like a small city with several restaurants and lots of prepared foods. Anyway, we were in the bakery section, and I decided to ask someone stocking the baked goods if they had any gluten free bread. She pointed to a display where there were two kinds, white (potato flour) and whole grain (didn't notice, was too distracted by the white bread). I picked up the bread and it was SOFT! I teared up and yelled ""OMG it's soft!"" to my friend. I couldn't quite squeezing it and saying ""it's so soft!"" the whole time we were in the checkout. As soon as I got home, I opened the bag and ate a slice. It was amazing!"

"Georgians are also well-known for their friendliness and hospitality and I personally experienced this during my 2 visits. But closely watching over Tbilisi on one edge of the Narikala is the ‘Mother of Georgia’, a colossal statue of a lady holding a sword on one hand and a bowl of wine on the other. The wine symbolizes Georgia’s hospitality towards those who come as friends while the sword symbolizes the country’s readiness to quell those who come as enemies."

"It's easy to understand why. When it comes to value for money, vacation rentals including self catering options, they are small and more private space to yourself also makes it possible to spend as much as it would take for your transportation and sightseeing. You will have to worry about people partying or other disturbances around your own kitchen.

"If you have decided on your colour palette for the wedding, you should have a good idea of what colour your bridesmaids will be wearing. At that point, it is time to choose the bridesmaid dresses. Some women, when they think of a bridesmaid dress simply cringe, however with today’s new styles with charming ruffle trims, floral embellishments, flattering necklines, varied hemlines, and scope of fabric, there is no need to worry."

"Why did he let her leave, with his own back turned?"
"The first whiff is a clean, clear rye, much like the standard Sazerac, which yields to just a touch of fruit mixed in to the rye spice. The flavor is what grabs you right away. There is plenty of rye, but with a sweet, fruity note from the dessert wine, very unlike the sweetness you traditionally get from the corn in rye whiskey. Each sip is a mouthful of contrasting flavors - spicy and sweet, dry and fruity, whiskey and wine in perfect balance. The party continues into the finish. It's hard to believe that the few months this whiskey spent in the wine casks is enough to have such a pronounced influence on its character, but it can't be denied."
"Jerry Anomie was born in Tennessee but moved to Houston as a young child. Music never appealed to him growing up until a friend of his who worked at a record store played him the Sex Pistols and Iggy Pop. He ended up meeting Iggy soon after that, which helped give him a new outlook on life. Having recently spent five and a half years in prison, he started realizing he didn't have to be a criminal. He could be in a band!"

"What annoys me most of all is that upon being labelled a racist, you immediately refuted the claim and provided incontrovertible evidence of the opposite being true. Why wasn’t that the end of it? I too have Oriental help and, like you, am very fond of them. I like to give them a little slap on the buttocks as they clean my bidet in the home cinema and sometimes bow to them as they’re leaving for the day and say “ah so” as a show of cultural solidarity. I also found Mickey Rooney’s turn as Mr Fukkamoto (or whatever his name was) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s exceptionally funny, not because he ridicules Chinese/Japanese people, turning them into a preposterous caricature, but because he inhabits the role and brings out the inherent humanity of those two races. Why couldn’t people accept your affection for Asians on face value and move on? (Maybe next time mention Mickey Rooney.)"

Honey Irani appears in front of the camera in one of her first roles as an actress playing the mean and spoilt mommy’s girl Sheila. I love the way she stands and screams as an iron burns her sari rather than just lifting out a hand to move it away. She really does seem to believe she is the delicate flower her mother calls her and she wonderfully nasty towards her cousin. Ranjeet is appropriately sleazy and obviously the villain once he turns up in a selection of increasingly bad shirts and terrible scarves.

"OK, so this is supposed to be about getting a girlfriend fast……however, a common problem for single men (and indeed women) is that they are in way too much of a rush to find ‘the one’ because they are fed up with the dating game.

First and foremost, it’s become a great tool to keep myself on track and accountable, but it also provides a therapeutic way to process my feelings, figure out solutions, and track my progress. The fact that it’s become a daily destination for so many people looking for a little inspiration, honesty, laughter, or whatever… well, it astounds me. It’s a great source of pride. Thanks to this blog, I’ve been able to connect with and learn from so many wonderful people all over the planet, and that astounds me too!"
Having observed the assignment desk area with the NFL Network- I know how diligent they are with their breaking news. I am sure that they saw the news hit as soon as we did. I’m also sure they began calling everyone from police to team contacts for a confirmation and refused to report the news until they had solid facts confirmed.

"Therefore, taking into account that the thesis that is presented by the first Defendant, through the adequate means that are placed at his disposal by the other Defendants, raises the suspicion of the involvement of the first and second Applicants in the practice of criminal actions, albeit in a negligent way, among the general public, and that they, having been made arguidos at a given point in time, saw the criminal inquiry archived in relation to them, one has to conclude that it must be the rights of the Defendants that cede to the rights of the Applicants."
"Once upon a time, there was a red cell phone. It was an LG EnV3 that wasn’t really red, but maroon, and it belonged to Bekah. Every day, it faithfully did its job. It took her phone calls and collected her text messages. It rang and beeped mostly appropriately so that she would know to respond to the other people trying to contact her. Most of the time, the phone even maintained a good relationship with the Jawbone Bluetooth unit. They were hardly ever not on speaking terms, working in tandem so that Bekah could multitask and use her phone while driving. Life was good for the red cell phone. Many thought provoking discussions were facilitated by it, and even more encouraging and informative text messages were passed along by it."

I loved that Julia Quinn created this cinderella tale within the Bridgerton series. Although the book you were hoping that Benedict would see but he doesn’t well that is until the very end.
"In terms of plot, the book is well executed. Amy and J. C. hunt for the murderer and make some interesting discoveries along the way. When I found out who the killer was, I had a kind of duh moment but it didn’t detract from my enjoyment of the novel. I was interested in knowing how J. C. and Amy would trap the killer and how the killer managed to evade detection for so long. In some ways, the story’s evolution and world reminded me of Christine Feehan’s Ghostwalkers series or Jayne Castle’s novels (which is a compliment to my mind), though there are enough differences that the comparison was fleeting."
"When she isn't tapping away at her keyboard, Margaret engages in an epic battle against her never-ending laundry hampers, cajoles the flowers in her yard, sings into her hairbrush, and has been known to hold entire conversations speaking only in movie quotes."

"Overtime it is. Five minutes or sudden death.The toss is to our advantage, Thunder have the wind behind and the slight slope to speed the ball."
"The Jeffersonian Constitution has been misrepresented as much as or more than Jeffersonian philosophy. It was not “strict construction,” a nonstarter, nor even states’ rights. It was state sovereignty. Jefferson (and Madison, too) may be quoted ad infinitum to this effect. The Virginia and Kentucky documents of 1798-1800 spell out beyond any doubt that the final defense of freedom in the American system is the people acting in their only constitution-making identity, that of their sovereign states. The states were the legitimate and peaceful resort to protect the liberties of their citizens and themselves as communities from federal encroachment."

"Chris Mann from Team Christina finally returned to his opera roots, singing Ave Maria. As a not big fan, I was surprised because he almost won me over with this performance. His control and power and grace are undeniable, and this was definitely my favorite of his performances. I hope he sticks with more opera/classic songs that aren’t too ballad-y next week, songs that he can really go all out on without sounding too cliché."

"Despite Romney’s well-established ability to shape shift his positions on any number of issues or topics, depending what audience he’s talking to at the time, he’s worked hard to put himself into a corner on lending even a pittance of pity to union workers in general and public union workers specifically. His antagonistic attitude toward government at all levels, especially the federal government, promising to take an ax to it if he’s elected, seems to working against him in Ohio, where public union workers, their family, friends and supporters, have not only not forgotten the battle they waged last year over SB 5, the bill that would have effectively gutted collective bargaining as its been successfully practiced for nearly 30 years, but appear ready to send another message to those who want to rub out unions by voting for the President."

"Jurors heard recordings of those conversations this afternoon. In a June 9th 2010 conversation, Steele is heard agreeing to give Fairfax a $400 advance to pay for his trip to Oregon City, where Cyndi Steele was visiting her mother. However, Edgar Steele continues to contest the authenticity of the recordings, and one person posting a comment to this story maintains that audio experts identified 351 edits on these manufactured tapes. Unfortunately, the judge earlier ruled the two experts could not testify. Fairfax's testimony will continue on Thursday April 28th."

"The words of Carl Jenkinson underline the impact of one result, the ensuing wobble understandable. With the injury list at any one point in time containing a number of key experienced personnel, to have returned to form twice in one season is of great credit. Finding that consistency over the full campaign is the next step, a stride that has proven too great for some previous groups of Arsenal players in the last decade."
"I eat a healthy diet. I’ve been vegetarian for 10 years, and I recently became a vegan, due to some digestive issues and a possible link with my MTHFR polymorphism.

"My card base is kraft, with a mat of ivory, and then some ""chic"" dp bought at Mike's pad. Didn't show who put it out because I used part of it previously and so the name is gone..sorry people. It's a soft denim colored blue and ivory so I wanted to bring that out in my flower. After cutting the different size flowers I brushed them with denim colored ink that Adirondack puts out. Now for some fun I used the Scor-Pal and did a bit of pleating out of the ivory card stock and then added some crocheted ribbon stuff to give it that vintage look. Guess I need to use some of that on myself to add to my vintage look (mine is wrinkled skin and old age spots) not so classy, me thinks. After I slapped it together I added the little flag sentiment ""thank-you"" found in the Hello Hyacinth set. Put a few blingers on and I'm through here.So now it's your turn to get a bag (not a live one like me) and see what you can come up with.

"Like I mentioned, I’ve been big on getting cheese from the remnant or manager special box at bloomingfoods. The cheeses I’ve gotten recently are goat gouda, cocoa dusted cardona, and kentucky blue cheese. The remnant section is great because it gives you a chance to try a cheese you may not normally. It also allows you to have an expensive cheese for a fraction of the cost and without the fear of it going moldy in the fridge. Plus, if you’re cooking for one, you can make a small chunk of cheese last a for a few meals. If you’ve never had cardona before, I would suggest looking for it. It’s apparently an artisanal goat cheese from Wisconsin. The creator of it got the idea from one of his favorite sandwiches- a piece of swiss cheese and a hershey bar on bread. I can barely detect the cocoa in this cheese, fortunately. Anyway, I know a lot of people are leery to buy food that is marked down to sell. I’ve never had a problem, though, and it certainly beats paying full price."

"My baby is two years old today! Moms always tell me time with kids flies by. I believe them, and it seems to be so much more true as adoptive parents. Even though we met Zane when he was 16 months old, we feel like we've been his parents forever. In some ways it's like he's always been here, but in other ways, like today, it feels like I've only had him for a few short weeks. I'm not ready for him to be two already. It still seems like we just came home with him."
"A rambutan has that crazy sort of alien fruit look. It’s spiky tentacles are actually quite soft to the touch and make it even more exotic in appearance. Once red, these peel off easily with the skin which is a little woody, but pliable. You can break the skin with a knife or your fingernail and peel it back revealing a juicy translucent globe. There’s a clear seed inside which can be avoided once you bite into it or you can cut it out.So how does it taste? I found it to be a little bit melon-like but with the texture of a ripe grape. It sort of reminds me of a lychee, but not many people have tried that either so I don’t know if that helps. It doesn’t really drip juices, but seems like it should. Depending on the ripeness of the fruit, it can vary in sweetness, but I’ve yet to taste one that gives an unripe sensation; however, an overripe one can seem a little bit fermented. These are fun, but maybe a little too extreme to be seen regularly in a kid’s lunchbox. They can seem expensive, but there’s very little waste and it’s not like you’ll eat dozens of them. It’s a fun treat in the world of interesting fruit."

"You're trying to write a novel in a hurry. That means you can't afford to spend too much time sitting staring into space looking for inspiration. Whether you're an outline writer or strictly seat-of-the-pants, I'd recommend keeping at least a rough list of cool ideas that you might put in. Start noting stuff down sometime in September and keep the list to hand. Every time you find yourself staring off into space in November, the first thing you do is check the list."
"Possible penalties for practicing corporate medicine include $1,000 fine for each violation with each day a separate infraction, and the possibility of third-degree felony changes for each violation against the doctor in question."
"The Replicators have, in deed, advanced. Five of them have now taken on human form. One of them is even a Scottish Lord from Days of Our Lives! the humanoid Replicators have not quite hit T-1000 territory yet, but there are hints of their malleability and some mind reading powers. They are modeled after Reese, so they possess her flaw. The SG-1 team cons one of the more advanced models into betraying the others by convincing him their flaw is too dangerous to let them off world to reproduce. They plan to reverse the time device back to the way the Asgard intended and take him with them, but in reality, he becomes frozen in time with the others because even he is deemed too dangerous."
"Remember the green light that just made him giggle and grin? Well that same pretty light is now the focus of much attention by the tiny man. It's no longer just for looking, laughing, and smiling at - It's for touching, grabbing, and trying to get! Thank goodness our camera lens is very durable and cleans up so nicely."

"Disagree with me if you wish, but to your own dismay. December 21, 2012 could still be the end of the world if we do not act accordingly. Superstitious or not, it could happen. And we are on the right track to destroying ourselves and everything on this planet."

"I still ate right low fat, high fiber. I just ate too much. I started not writing down what I ate but rather just kept track of it my head. I also cut back on exercise. It got cold out so I quit walking outside and I never started back with my indoor exercise. All this resulted in weight gain. I knew better but I became OK with it."

"”We let a lot of houses fall in,” Dr. Pilkey said. ”I’m proud of that.” But houses threatened here and there are not the truest test of whether a state’s politicians can withstand pressure for stabilization, he said."
"...the school's so-called hidden curriculum, subtle presentations of political or cultural ideas, imparts important cultural values. School activities such as spelling bees and sports encourage competition and showcase success. Children also receive countless messages that their society's culture is both practically and morally good.Taught to think our culture is both ""practically and morally good,"" is it any wonder that things continue to be so bad? If our culture is good, then there's obviously no need to change things in any real or radical way. The same book also goes on to say that ""schools further socialize young people into culturally approved gender roles,"" something that, as a person who often chooses to identify as a feminist, and has a good handful of queer friends, disturbs me on multiple levels."
"Time, the fourth one"
"But others come to Italy to stay. They set down roots and become part of the local colourful scenery. They are looked upon kindly by neighbours especially with regard to food and fashion and child-rearing (Oh but how can they know? They are foreigners!) Or they are regarded with deep and unfeeling suspicion. I know that when I moved here with my mixed children and mud-splattered car and unruly red hair and, every so often, a wild summer party, my neighbours decided that I was a hippie and a drug addict (WHAAT? HIPPIES DON'T WEAR DIOR). It was even whispered at my kids' school that I had had my four children with four different fathers. Can you imagine dealing with four exes?? Pluh-eeze."

However, Tampa Bay is in need of secondary help with the pending legal problems of CB Talibs. Barron will give them some potential to work with on defending pass plays."

I realize that our job is to raise them in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; that we are to live out loud for Jesus in front of them and that we are to equip them in the Word. I also realize they are responsible to God for the choices they make once they become adults.

"Jeanne planned this cruise to be her biggest and grandest voyage ever. She truly wanted to spend time with her Quacker friends on the most spectacular ship ever built. In her eyes, Jeanne always felt the cruises were about all of you and not about her. This was not an ego trip for her, but a way to have Quackers meet other Quackers and form friendships that would last a lifetime. She was proud that her trips were like no other cruises, just as her Quackers were like no others."

"Beverly recently started dating someone, let’s call him Steve, after being single for 30 years. Beverly and Steve met at the funeral of a mutual friend. Before her friend died, Beverly was considering going into business with him. A year later, Beverly wanted to follow up on the business opportunity but needed some files to move forward. She swears that she distinctly heard her friend’s voice (from beyond the grave) say, “Call him.” And she knew exactly who “him” was – Steve."
"A fun fact. I found out mine and Olivias connection (more than going to school in the same city) It sounds really stretched, but it’s actually not as far as it sounds. Cousins girlfriends sister-in-laws friend. That’s Olivia! Haha. Small world isn’t it?"

Anyone would be lucky to find a comparable hotel room for under $300.
"The goals you have in life, the major ones that is, are hard to grasp sometimes. They seem so far away, like we come so far only to go even further and it always seem just out of reach. Today, you need to stop looking at where the goal is, but where you are and be proud of how far you come. For example, my business, four years ago it was looking on the verge of death and we were pretty scared here. One by one new clients came in and every month we got better, then every year we became more stable, till finally this year we got too much work and needed to grow. We are still not where we want to be, but I will take where we are and proud of what we did to make it."
"There isn’t much of this going on in today’s world! There is a lot of fixin’ our thoughts on things that are none of these. You hear parents yelling at their kids for foul language, when the kids get it from their parents; you see people at work trying to get by with whatever they can, instead of working to the fullest of their ability; society is full of pornography – not only the hard stuff that wrecks marriages and families, but soft porn, watched on tv, seen at the movies, displayed on magazine pages until we become immunized to its effects; fidelity in relationships or marriages is thrown out the window – after all, if it’s kept hidden, it’s ok, right?; violence in video games, movies, loss of life taken lightly – we are honoring the horrors that our military face on a regular basis – things that mess with their heads for the rest of their lives; bodies are thrown from one lover to the other for instant gratification; babies are ripped from their mother’s womb, deemed an inconvenience from a sexual act that most likely should not have taken place anyhow; deceit is prevalent all around as times are hard and people fear for their survival, yet refuse to let God handle it all; lying is used to get us out of anything we don’t want to deal with; rage runs rampant from the highways to our homes. The list goes on and on…."

"I saw this on Yahoo, April 30 1945 was when a great evil committed suicide rather than be captured by the Soviet troops that were closing in on the Reichtag and the Chancellor building. The German garrison at Berlin were contesting every block with the Soviets but there were more Soviets with combat training and far fewer Germans, the Germans fought with fanaticism born of fear and desperation, the Soviet reprisals against the German civilians were well documented when German troops earlier had recaptured some German territory in Vistula, the gang rape and executions were documented by photo's and survivor eye witnesses. The German troops fought to buy time for the civilians to escape and of the false hope of all the wonder weapons and reinforcements that were promised by Geobbels the propaganda minister. For more information on the battle of Berlin or Gotterdammerung as the surviving Germans called it."

"The film screening left many stunned. I had my sister next to me, crying. It was a tear-jerker, undoubtedly. But to imagine that this was a plight of one of the 6 million Jews that were exterminated (plus another 1 million as ‘others’) , it did shake the foundations."
"Now, I live in Aberdeen, which puts me very, very far from that horticultural idyll. When I say ""whatever I can find"" I don't mean whatever there is in the garden, but whatever they have in the supermarket. And let me tell you, that can often mean, ""not much""."

"Citrus salt, Italian salt and Moroccan salt. I just bought rock salt and added different herbs and spice combinations. The Moroccan one has coriander (cilantro) cumin, chilli flakes, black pepper corns, and the Italian has chilli flakes, oregano, onions flakes and garlic flakes and black pepper corns. The Citrus is just the zest of two lemons dried in the microwave and added to the rock salt then ground in my little electric grinder."
What wonderful books did you get this week?

Sudocreme (for those most intimate bits!)
"Volume 16, released earlier this month, starts in Tokyo, where a foreigner called Judy is planning to get married to a Japanese lad. His family, and especially his grandfather, is opposed. Basically, the whole volume traces an arc towards her final acceptance by his family. But the clever bit is that the story echoes the relationship between Rita and Masataka Taketsuru, the founder of the Nikka whisky (of which more here). Taketsuru's marriage to Rita, a Scottish woman, was at first not welcomed by his family (or her's) but they lived out their lives together in Japan. The story of Rita and Masataka is introduced near the end of the manga and resonates with the modern couple's experience."

Jude must address some false teachers and there are teachers who pervert the grace of God to sensuality.
"Pastor Maldonado: It’s an unbelievable feeling winning my first race. The car felt really consistent, was fantastic to drive and our pace was strong throughout. Alonso was chasing me hard but we looked after our tyres well and I managed to open the gap towards the end. The team has worked so hard all year and this win is for them. To be the first Venezuelan to win a Formula One race is a big honour and hopefully I will win more races in the future."

"Rhythm is a very good thing...until it is not. I have missed some very great bargains following that rhythmic “get the heck out of here” mall march in my head. Getting on a bad rhythm is different than a bad habit. A bad habit is a single behaviour that you repeat regardless of the knowledge that it is doing you no good. Rhythm is how we have learned to flow through our days we don’t think about it, it just propels us along developing a bad rhythm is easier than you think. Good or bad that rhythm you've developed is a comfort to you. I learned that way back in design school. White pillow, blue pillow, white pillow, blue pillow, is the subconscious calmer. The 'thing' in the room that you can't quite put your finger on that gives you a sense of peace and comfort. It does not matter if the material is ugly and hard on the eyes; gross pillow, ugly pillow, gross pillow, ugly pillow has the same calming effect as pretty pillow, cute pillow, pretty pillow, cute pillow. It is the rhythm that makes you feel good."

"Yesterday I watched three people be baptized into the Catholic Church, and two more make their profession of Faith before all five were confirmed, thus completing their full initiation.

Tonight I was talking to my dad and I told him how she wanted to go to UC Davis and then I said but she wasn't sure cause she doesn't want to leave me, it was a lie. She cant wait to get away from me, and that breaks my heart daily, its one thing to admit it to myself, but a totally different thing to admit to other people. I dont know what I have done to make her so angry at me, why she is so angry at all of us."

"And the other nice thing about letting go of the lifestyle and just loving GOD and others is that it tends to eliminate the gray areas that we Christians run into. Rather than looking at something and struggling over whether it's right or wrong, black or white, you're faced with this question of if whatever it is you want to do will be loving to GOD and/or loving to others."

"Wales has long been associated with King Arthur. If you consider the red dragon on the Welsh flag, it makes perfect sense that Arthur Pendragon - the “head dragon” - should have lived and ruled there. But even Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose statue stands in the atmospheric Circle of Legends at Tintern station along with King Arthur's, admits that Arthur originated in England and the legend spread across the border."

"Because it’s all about one objective: ASSIMILATION. The sooner we get off the reserve, the sooner they push the Land Management Agreement on us, & the sooner we accept these and start living in the cities or start selling our land then the agreements that were signed over a hundred years ago will be null and void. We as a people, with our Aboriginal rights and Treaty rights will cease to exist, and this would make the government really happy. So take these cuts for what they are an attack on us as a people. So pick up your pen or whatever and write a letter to the Minister of Health, write to your local MP’s these are just the cuts we can see, what about the ones that we won’t see until we have to see a doctor and need medication or worse a medical procedure and we have to shell out. Enough is enough! Let’s not sit back and be passive about these things anymore. If we let them get away with this we open the door for more, cuz if you give the government an inch they are gonna take a mile. Otherwise if we do nothing then the governments position holds true, the only good ndn is a dead ndn…."
